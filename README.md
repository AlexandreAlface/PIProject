### Introduction
The IPBeja library staff identified the need to validate and update
information on scientific publications whose authors are teachers and
researchers at the institution. To do so, they have to manually consult various
scientific publication databases to find those whose authors are affiliated with
IPBeja.
There are currently several APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) for scientific publication databases
scientific publications available on the Web and previously identified, whose data can
be used by applications developed specifically for user consultation.
Last year, a prototype web system was developed that allows
data on researchers' publications to be obtained from the Scopus and Web
of Science database APIs, enabling various other data management operations by
library staff. This web system consists of a frontend developed
in Angular and an API in Laravel.

### Objectives
This edition of the project aims to continue developing this prototype with a view to
order to correct several problems identified by the Library Director, overcome
some other limitations of the previous work, and add new use cases.
The system should continue to be supported by the same technologies that were used in the
previous version: platforms (Angular and Laravel), database management system (mySQL) and
Excel/CSV generated from the software.

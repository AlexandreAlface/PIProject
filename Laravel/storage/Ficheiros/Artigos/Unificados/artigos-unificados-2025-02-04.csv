The study revealed that colour theory is one of the most influential theories related to audiovisual and multimedia, but there is a perception that colour is strictly linked to the image. This result led to the need for a structured and well-founded connection between colour and sound, producing information that can address the identified perception. Therefore, this article aims to conduct a literature review on the theoretical principles of the relationship between colour and sound and relate it as one of the fundamental principles for a degree in audiovisual and multimedia. For this purpose, a review was carried out on the concept of audiovisual and multimedia, the literature on the mentioned fundamentals, and different ways of relating colour to sound and music. In summary, this research will allow a better understanding of the theory of colour concerning sound in the various curricular units of the bachelor’s degree in Audiovisual and Multimedia at IPBeja, and it can also serve other related research or similar courses.","Audiovisual ; Colour ; Multimedia ; Sound",0,"Capítulo em livro",,"Artes H Desporto",Scopus,N/A,"Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal)",N/A,N/A,"Aldo Passarinho; Tiago Nunes; Rui Travasso; Teresa Barradas","0000-0001-6628-4147; 0000-0001-9142-7349; 0000-0001-6609-5880; 0000-0001-7745-771X",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

The monitoring of soil quality is crucial when changes from rainfall-fed to irrigated crop systems occur. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of different crop successions in the Mediterranean area under irrigation and different technical practices. The soil nitrogen–phosphorous–potassium (NPK) and soil organic carbon (SOC) balances were observed in four fields with irrigated annual crops in a two-year succession timeframe, namely, sunflower–maize (P1), sunflower–clover (P2), maize–sunflower (P3), and alfalfa–alfalfa (P4). The SOC and nutrient balance, integrating the total irrigation, mineral fertilizers, and exported yield, was calculated for each farm. Except for maize–sunflower succession (P3), all fields presented a negative SOC balance at the end of the two-year crop succession, indicating losses from 2.84 to 4.91 Mg SOC ha−1 y−1. While in N-fixing plants the soil N decreased, in the remaining crops a surplus was observed, possibly leading to future N losses. The continuous depletion of soil P revealed a potential underestimation of this nutrient. Soil K appears to be related to specific crop management practices, namely, crop residue incorporation after harvest. In annual irrigated crops under Mediterranean conditions, crop succession can induce soil fertility degradation if conservation practices are absent.","annual crops ; carbon dynamics ; management practices ; soil macronutrients balance",0,"Artigos em revista",1908,Biociências,Ambas,"ERDF (UIDB/04683/2020) European Regional Development Fund","University of Évora (Evora, Portugal); Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia da Universidade Nova de Lisboa (Caparica, Portugal); Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal)",N/A,N/A,"Cláudia Neto; Adriana Catarino; Justino Sobreiro; José das Dores; Manuel Patanita; Alexandra Tomaz; Patrícia Palma","0000-0002-3046-0556; 0000-0002-4792-3633; 0000-0001-8871-7409; 0000-0001-6077-8752; 0000-0002-2122-9950; 0000-0001-9129-112X; 0000-0002-9719-079X",N/A,N/A,N/A,AGRICULTURE-BASEL,11,,,21

Despite this, the intensification of agriculture combined with climate change leads to a potential decrease in water quality and water management practices are essential to improve agro-environmental sustainability. The aim of this study was to assess the water quality for irrigation and potential ecological status of the reservoir (using support chemical parameters). The results showed biological oxygen demand values above the maximum stipulated for an excellent ecological potential in all sampling periods except April 2018 and December 2020 (with the highest values of 10 mg L−1 O2 in dry periods). Most of the total nitrogen concentrations (TN) surpassed those stipulated for a good ecological potential (0.96 ≤ TN ≤ 2.44 mg L−1 N). In fact, TN and total suspended solids were the main parameters used for water classification. From the perspective of irrigation and according to FAO guidelines regarding infiltration rate, these waters presented light to moderate levels of restrictions. Thus, the results revealed that the decrease in the water quality status and its possible impact on the soil infiltration rate can be related, in part, to the meteorological conditions and to the intensive agricultural practices developed around the drainage basin. Despite that, as the Lage reservoir is part of Brinches–Enxoé hydraulic circuit, the water recirculation is also an important factor that may have affected the results obtained. Furthermore, the experimental design, integrating ecological status, irrigation parameters, and the impact on soil systems; using the same parameters from different perspectives; allowed us to have a global idea of water contamination and its impact on agroecosystems, improving river basin management processes.","Alqueva project ; irrigation water ; potential ecological status ; soil impact",1,"Artigos em revista",514,Biociências,Ambas,"EC (POCI-01-0145-FEDER-007690) European Commission","University of Évora (Evora, Portugal); Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia da Universidade Nova de Lisboa (Caparica, Portugal); Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal)",N/A,N/A,"Adriana Catarino; Inês Martins; Clarisse Mourinha; João Santos; Alexandra Tomaz; Pedro Anastácio; Patrícia Palma","0000-0002-4792-3633; N/A; 0000-0002-4671-9884; 0000-0001-9129-112X; 0000-0003-1808-3847; 0000-0002-9719-079X",N/A,N/A,N/A,WATER,4,,,18

The joint estimation of the water footprint (WF) and the carbon footprint (CF) can help to comprehensively assess the environmental implications and sustainability associated with water-intensive grapevine cultivation. In this study, the WF and CF, of the farming stage of grapes production, were calculated for three years, in three vineyards located in southern Portugal. Data used for the calculation included meteorological data, irrigation requirements, energy use, fertilizers, and pesticide inputs. The total WF mean value for the study period was 223 m3 ton−1, lower than values found for similar conditions, but the blue component, related to irrigation, was predominant, with a higher proportion (75%) occurring during the driest year. The mean total CF was 98 kg CO2e ton−1; the major contributors were fuel use, fertilizer greenhouse gas emissions, and energy for irrigation. The factor analysis revealed relationships between footprint components, yielding latent variables participated by irrigation water and energy use, pollution loads and agrichemicals use.

For this purpose, soil chemical parameters were evaluated on three sampling dates, forage maize yield and yield components were compared, and the balances of soil carbon (SC), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) were evaluated. The results showed that the maize yield obtained in TB was significantly higher than in TA. The differences in precipitation that occurred over the two years influenced the yield in both treatments. The SC, available P, and pH were significantly higher in TB at every sampling date, mainly in the subsurface layer, and overall enrichment in nitrogen was observed.

A study of soil properties was carried out in southern Portugal, in three farm fields with irrigated annual crops (layers 0–20 cm and 20–40 cm), over three years. Factor Analysis (FA) and Discriminant Analysis (DA) were used to analyze the data. With FA, the observed variables were grouped into a smaller number of latent variables related to soil attributes. Discriminant Analysis was used to classify and identify the most dominant attributes and indicators for the time and space variability of soil parameters. The FA performed for the surface layer included factors related to texture, water and nutrient retention capacity, chemical composition, and soil fertility. In the sub-surface layer, the factor structure was similar, with four factors related to texture, chemical composition, nutrient availability, and soil fertility. The most influential factors and variables in temporal discrimination (sampling dates) in both layers were those related to chemical composition, with electric conductivity as the preponderant indicator. As for the spatial differentiation (fields), the dominant factor in the surface layer was texture, and in the sub-surface layer, nutrient availability. The most important discriminant indicators of spatial variability were fine sand proportion and available potassium, respectively, for the surface and sub-surface layers.

A two-seasons field experiment was conducted in South Portugal to study the effect of water regimes and nitrogen fertilization on wheat yield, grain quality and water use evaluated with water productivity and water footprint indicators. The water regime treatments were full irrigation, supplemental irrigation, and rainfed. Nitrogen fertilizer treatments, including conventional and enhanced efficiency fertilizers (EEF) were distinguished by N splitting and timing over the crop cycle. Contrasting meteorological variables in the two years caused distinct wheat productive responses. Although leading to lower grain yields, supplemental irrigation guaranteed a water productivity similar to full irrigation. The use of EEFs in which 50% of the total nitrogen was applied at the booting phase had a positive significant effect on grain protein content and on dough rheologic properties, indicating that late nitrogen applications benefit the technological quality of wheat. The average total water footprints estimated for the two seasons showed no relevant differences but the partition of the green, blue and grey components in irrigated wheat varied, with an increased importance of blue water consumptive use in the second year of the experiment. In fact, the ratio blue water footprint/green water footprint increased from 0.40 to 2.00 due to higher irrigation requirements. High grey water footprint in rainfed wheat was mostly influenced by lower yields in 2018–2019, and by an advantageous rainfall distribution during the 2017–2018 season. No significant reduction in grey water footprint was observed when using EEFs. A multivariate statistical approach through factor analysis (FA) and multivariate linear regression (MLR) was used to examine the data structure and correlation. FA resulted in three-factor models of yield and water use, yield components and wheat quality, in the first season. In the second, drier, season, variables most related with irrigation water use were clustered in one detached factor. The stepwise MLR pointed to a good prediction capability of water footprints from NDVI measured with proximal sensors at booting, anthesis, maturation and/or tillering.","Factor analysis ; Irrigation water productivity ; Multivariate linear regression ; Nitrogen fertilization ; Water footprint ; Wheat",19,"Artigos em revista",107214,Biociências,Ambas,"EC (0145-FEDER-023262) European Commission","Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia da Universidade Nova de Lisboa (Caparica, Portugal); Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal); Centro Operativo e de Tecnologia de Regadio (Beja, Portugal)",N/A,N/A,"Alexandra Tomaz; José Ferro Palma; Tiago Ramos; Maria Natividade Costa; Elizabete Rosa; Marta Santos; Luís Boteta; José Dôres; Manuel Patanita","N/A; 0000-0001-9129-112X",N/A,N/A,N/A,"AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT",,,,14

Mediterranean regions are especially susceptible, given the predominant climate and the expanding of irrigation areas. In this study, two indices to assess the risk of salinization (RSA) and sodification (RSO), previously applied at a regional scale, were used in a hydro-agricultural area (AHA) in Southern Portugal, in ten crop fields. Information on climate, irrigation water quality, soil characteristics, and land use was obtained from large databases and from local data. The results revealed the feasibility of using the RSA and RSO indices both on large and smaller scales, seeing as most of the area in the monitored crop fields presented the same risk classes (62% in RSA and 78% in RSO). Deviations were due to the reduction in scores for drainage and, in the case of RSO, the assigned irrigation method based on the land occupation class. Considering that different spatial scales of risk assessment are associated with different objectives and management options, a risk management framework was outlined following a multi-scale perspective for mitigation actions in salt-sensitive areas, ranging from territorial planning to the adoption of on-farm practices that can contribute to the sustainability of irrigated agriculture.","Irrigation areas ; Irrigation water quality ; Risk assessment ; Soil and water management practices ; Soil salinization ; Soil sodification",4,"Artigos em revista",3070,Biociências,Ambas,"EC (UIBD/00616/2020) European Commission","Centro de Química-Vila Real (Vila Real, Portugal); University of Évora (Evora, Portugal); Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia da Universidade Nova de Lisboa (Caparica, Portugal); Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal); Centro Operativo e de Tecnologia de Regadio (Beja, Portugal)",N/A,N/A,"Alexandra Tomaz; Maria João Costa; João Coutinho; José Dôres; Adriana Catarino; Inês Martins; Clarisse Mourinha; Isabel Guerreiro; Maria Margarida Pereira; Marta Fabião; Luís Boteta; Manuel Patanita; Patrícia Palma","N/A; 0000-0001-9129-112X",N/A,N/A,N/A,WATER,21,,,14

Cover crops in the interrow of irrigated vineyards change the dynamics of water extraction and it is expected that the patterns of vines' water relations will be modified, also changing their productive responses. This study took place over two seasons in 'Tempranillo' grapevines in a vineyard in South Portugal, where a cover crop was sown in the inter-rows of half the study area (SCC) while maintaining resident vegetation in the remaining (RV). Five water regime treatments were applied: Full irrigation (200 mm irrigation amount-I200); moderate irrigation (150 mm-I150); deficit irrigation (100 mm-I100); ultra-deficit irrigation (50 mm-I50); rainfed (I0). Measurements of predawn leaf water potential (ΨPD), stomatal conductance (gs), photosynthetic rate (An), and transpiration rate (E) were made during the final stages of the growth cycle. Data of soil water availability, yield and growth variables, and berries and wine composition were also used. Significant interactions between the effect of soil management and water regime were observed on ΨPD. A water competition effect exerted by the cover crop could be responsible for reduced water loss and carbon assimilation, whenever Spring rain is lower and/or the cover crop biomass development is not controlled. Differences in gs and An observed at midday and late measurements reflect the influence of the daily increase of atmospheric water demand. Stomatal closure of grapevines was less affected in plots of higher soil water storage capacity. The correlation between ΨPD and gs was higher in the midday and late measurements, pointing to the regulation of stomatal response in response to water availability and daily environmental conditions. Principal components analysis (PCA) evidenced an influence of water deficit on metabolic responses that benefit fruit and wine quality. The cluster analysis (CA) revealed that no significant cluster of cases was clearly controlled by soil management or water regime in the first season but, in the second, drier season, significant clustering more irrigation- than soil managementcontrolled showed that a predominant influence of irrigation should be expected for 'Tempranillo' grapevines grown under dry Mediterranean conditions.","'Tempranillo' grapevines ; Cover crops ; Gas exchange parameters ; Irrigation ; Mediterranean environments ; Soil management ; Water relations",4,"Artigos em revista",,Biociências,Ambas,"EC (UIDP/04035/2020) European Commission","Instituto Superior de Agronomia, Universidade de Lisboa (Lisbon, Portugal); Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia da Universidade Nova de Lisboa (Caparica, Portugal); Universidad de Extremadura (Badajoz, Spain); Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal)",N/A,N/A,"Alexandra Tomaz; José Coleto Martínez; Carlos Arruda Pacheco","N/A; 0000-0001-9129-112X",N/A,N/A,N/A,"OENO ONE",3,191,208,18

A large proportion of the global irrigated area is affected by some degree of soil salinity or sodicity caused by the intensification of irrigation. The increase of the frequency of adverse climatic conditions, like high temperatures and variations in precipitation patterns caused by climate change, will potentially amplify these processes in arid, semi-arid, and Mediterranean areas. The use of integrated approaches for the spatial and temporal prediction of the risk of salinization and sodification in irrigated areas is of great value, helping in the decision-making regarding land uses and choice of more suitable agricultural practices. In this study, based on key criteria for the assessment of irrigation-related salinization processes (e.g., climate, topography, soil drainage, water quality for irrigation, and crop irrigation method), we developed a methodology for the prediction of soil salinity and sodicity risk in irrigated lands, using two composite indices, the Salinization Risk (RSA) index and the Sodification Risk (RSO) index. The application of these indices to a real scenario (a Mediterranean area in Southern Portugal) showed that 67% of the potentially irrigated area presented a low risk of salinity development, 68% had a moderate risk of sodification, and 16% was of high risk of sodicity development. Areas under moderate risk of salinization (26%) were mostly characterized by low slopes and fine-textured soils, like Luvisols and Vertisols, with limited drainage conditions. Areas with high risk of soil sodification presented a large incidence of low slope terrain, moderate-to-restricted soil drainage, in high clay content Luvisols, Vertisols and Cambisols, and land use dominated by annual crops irrigated with surface or sprinkler systems. These risk prediction tools have the potential to be used for resource use planning by policymakers and on-farm management decision by farmers, contributing to the sustainability of irrigated agriculture in Mediterranean regions.","Mediterranean regions ; Risk evaluation ; Soil salinity ; Soil sodicity ; Water quality for irrigation",30,"Artigos em revista",3569,Biociências,Scopus,"EC (ALT20-03-0145-FEDER-000004) European Commission","Linking Landscape, Environment, Agriculture And Food (Lisbon, Portugal); University of Évora (Evora, Portugal); Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia da Universidade Nova de Lisboa (Caparica, Portugal); Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal)",N/A,N/A,"Alexandra Tomaz; Patrícia Palma; Sofia Fialho; Ana Lima; Paula Alvarenga; Miguel Potes; Maria João Costa; Rui Salgado","N/A; 0000-0001-9129-112X",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Under water scarcity conditions and high atmosphere evaporative demand, the risks of decreased water quality, and land salinization are major threats to the sustainability of irrigated agriculture in this region. The assessment of the quality of irrigation water is increasingly important to ensure the maintenance of long-term salt balance at a crop, farm, and regional scale. This study is focused on the spatial and temporal variability of water quality for irrigation in the Alqueva reservoir (Southern Portugal). The assessment was performed every 2 months during a distinctive drought year (2017) and included inorganic ions (Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, NH4+, Cl−, F−, SO42−, NO3−, and NO2−), pH, and electric conductivity (ECW) of water. Sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) was calculated, and potential soil permeability problems were estimated. The assessment showed significantly higher values of the physicochemical parameters in the most upstream sites, located near tributaries inflows, and an upward trend in ion concentrations throughout the year, with significantly higher concentrations of Na+, Mg2+, Cl−, and SO42, registered through May to November, reflecting the severe drought felt in the summer, autumn, and winter. The evaluation of water quality for irrigation indicated a slight to moderate risk of reduced infiltration rates, which should be considered whenever sprinkler irrigation is used, mainly in fine-textured soils, which are prevalent in the irrigated area. The multivariate statistical approach, using principal component analysis and factor analysis, identified two principal components related to salinity and nutrient concentrations. The cluster analysis revealed three groups of similarity between samples pointing to a more time- than space-controlled pattern. Overall, the temporal dynamics of the water physicochemical parameters could indicate that an abnormal annual distribution of precipitation and temperature may distort seasonal differences. To prevent water and soil degradation, a more frequent assessment of the water quality should be considered, allowing for the selection of appropriate soil and water management measures in irrigated areas.","Drought ; Irrigation areas ; SAR ; Water quality assessment ; Water salinity",27,"Artigos em revista",93,Biociências,Ambas,"EC (UID/GEO/04035/2013) European Commission","Linking Landscape, Environment, Agriculture And Food (Lisbon, Portugal); University of Évora (Evora, Portugal); Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia da Universidade Nova de Lisboa (Caparica, Portugal); Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal)",N/A,N/A,"Alexandra Tomaz; Patrícia Palma; Sofia Fialho; Ana Lima; Paula Alvarenga; Miguel Potes; Rui Salgado","0000-0001-9129-112X; N/A",N/A,N/A,N/A,"ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT",2,,,17

Inter- and intra-annual variability in temperature and precipitation leads to increasing water scarcity. In fact, water is a scarce resource in Mediterranean regions, a problem that tends to intensify with global warming. Higher atmospheric evaporative demand conditions lead to the increment of crop water requirements, inducing larger use of irrigation water. One of the major threats to the sustainability of irrigated agriculture is the risk of land salinization, due to the reduction in water quality and to the increase of soil salt concentrations leading consequently to crop yield reductions and/or to soil degradation processes. Therefore monitoring salinity status is becoming increasingly important to prevent soil salinization processes. In this chapter, the following subjects will be addressed: (i) soil salinization processes; (ii) crops responses to salinity in a climate change scenario; (iii) water quality for irrigation criteria; (iv) modelling of soil salinity; (v) salinity management.

The consequences of this variability on wheat production are felt on its development cycle and productivity, making the production chain of this crop vulnerable to the occurrence of years with abnormal distributions of precipitation and with extreme temperatures. Adaptation strategies like irrigation or fertilization can help to cope with the negative impacts of climate uncertainty. This study evaluated the effects of water regime and nitrogen (N) fertilization techniques on wheat production in southern Portugal based on the results of three trials conducted in two agricultural years (2016/2017 and 2017/2018) with contrasting climate conditions. Phenology and yield were evaluated by comparing water regimes (R1, full irrigation; R2, supplemental irrigation at four stages: start of stem extension, booting, anthesis, grain filling; R0, rainfed (in 2017/2018)) and N fertilization splitting/timing and type (conventional and enhanced efficiency fertilizers (EEFs): controlled-release N, stabilized with nitrification inhibitor, and stabilized with urease inhibitor). Significant effects of water regime on grain yield were obtained in 2016/2017, a year with extreme aridity and high water requirements felt from the tillering stage, in the trial with conventional fertilizers. In 2017/2018, when a beneficial seasonal rainfall distribution occurred, water regime did not influence grain yield, pointing to the feasibility of supplementary irrigation to maximize water productivity. Nitrogen fertilization influenced yield and its components, with the highest values of grain yield being obtained with conventional fertilizer. Regardless of the possible effects on grain quality, the use of EEF did not prove to have an indisputable effect on wheat yield in the conditions under which the trials were conducted. Comparison of the results in the two years accentuates the need to continue the evaluation of the influence of agronomic management in wheat production in the context of adaptation to the climatic uncertainty in Mediterranean regions.","Climate change ; Climate uncertainty ; Enhanced efficiency fertilizers ; Grain yield ; Irrigation ; Nitrogen fertilization ; Wheat",10,"Artigos em revista",429,Biociências,Ambas,"FCT (LISBOA-01-0145-FEDER-023262) Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia","Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia da Universidade Nova de Lisboa (Caparica, Portugal); Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal); Centro Operativo e de Tecnologia de Regadio (Beja, Portugal)",N/A,N/A,"Manuel Patanita; Alexandra Tomaz; Tiago Ramos; Patrícia Oliveira; Luís Boteta; José Dôres","N/A; 0000-0001-9129-112X",N/A,N/A,N/A,PLANTS-BASEL,10,,,15

The demand for water and for fertilizers is increasing but so is the demand for water use efficiency (WUE) and for nutrient use efficiency (NUE). Increasing resource-use efficiency while reducing yield gaps can be addressed by suitable agricultural management practices, as in the case of crop rotations. Based on a demonstration project carried out in two farms located in Baixo Alentejo, within the Alqueva irrigation network, soil fertility parameters, WUE and NUE (for nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium) were studied in three maize-based cropping systems: a maize monoculture (M-M) and two rotations, barley+maize-barley (BM-B) and sunflower-barley+maize (S-BM). The total soil organic matter content increased in the two rotations, an important observation especially in soils with low organic content. The final balance of extractable phosphorus and potassium was positive in the BM-B rotation. Water use efficiency values point to a less balanced performance of the S-BM rotation. The WUE and the nitrogen NUE in the different crops and rotations followed a similar pattern. The M-M and BM-B crop successions showed the best indicators of NUE for nitrogen and phosphorus. In all the cropping systems, the potassium NUE was low, suggesting the need to carefully equate the additions of this nutrient by fertilization.","Alentejo ; Crop rotation ; Irrigation ; NUE ; Soil fertility ; WUE",9,"Artigos em revista",,Biociências,Ambas,"FCT (GEO/04035/2013) Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia","Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia da Universidade Nova de Lisboa (Caparica, Portugal); Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal); Centro Operativo e de Tecnologia de Regadio (Beja, Portugal)",N/A,N/A,"Alexandra Tomaz; Manuel Patanita; Isabel Guerreiro; José Dôres; Luis Boteta; José Ferro Palma","0000-0001-9129-112X; 0000-0002-2122-9950; N/A; 0000-0002-0951-5241",N/A,N/A,N/A,"SPANISH JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE",1,12,23,12

Knowledge about water uptake of grapevines in pedoclimatic conditions of high water availability is essential when considering the increasing use of irrigation in a previously rainfed crop. We studied the water uptake of irrigated grapevines under different soil covers. The study was carried out over 2 years in southern Portugal, a Mediterranean climate region, in ‘Aragonez’ grapevines planted in Vertisols. A cover crop was sown in half the area while maintaining the permanent resident vegetation in the remaining area. Five levels of annual irrigation supply were applied: 200, 150, 100 and 50 mm, and no irrigation. Soil moisture was monitored every 2 or 3 weeks, and weekly after the start of irrigation. Results show that water uptake in the interrows did not cease after the beginning of irrigation. Water uptake by the vines occurred to depths of approximately 3 m, hence 7.5 times greater than the cover crop root system depth. Results suggest that over time, the presence of the cover crop forces the vine root system, mainly its thinner roots, to seek water in increasingly deeper soil compartments.

Data were collected during two years from 'Aragonez' grapevines (Vitis vinifera L. syn. 'Tempranillo'). The experimental site was located in a private vineyard in the Baixo Alentejo, southern Portugal. The vineyard is grown on vertisols, with drip irrigation. In the 4 ha area under study, a cover crop in the interrow was sown in half the plots, with the permanent resident vegetation maintained in the other half. The irrigation treatments were: high water availability (200 mm annual irrigation supply); moderate water availability (150 mm annual irrigation supply); deficit irrigation (100 mm annual irrigation supply); ultra-deficit irrigation (50 mm annual irrigation supply); rainfed. The deficit and ultra-deficit irrigation treatments were conducted in accordance with the Regulate Deficit Irrigation (RDI) strategy. The vine's vegetative growth and yield responses influenced by irrigation in both years were: pruning weight, yield, and cluster weight. The quality responses were different in the two years of study: the grape composition parameters that showed significant differences were few and different each year; in wine composition, only in 2008 was the effect of irrigation on titratable acidity proven. Vegetative growth and yield were lower in the presence of the sown cover crop. The composition of grapes and wine was mostly affected by the surface cover in 2008, with the best performance for the phenolic compounds corresponding to plants growing on plots with permanent sown cover crop. The phenolic component in grapes benefited from the presence of the sown cover crop and the successful application of the RDI strategy.","Cover crop ; Irrigation ; Vertisols ; Vitis vinifera L.",9,"Artigos em revista",,Biociências,Ambas,N/A,"Instituto Superior de Agronomia, Universidade de Lisboa (Lisbon, Portugal); Universidad de Extremadura (Badajoz, Spain); Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal)",N/A,N/A,"Alexandra Tomaz; José Miguel Coleto Martinez; Carlos Arruda Pacheco","N/A; 0000-0001-9129-112X",N/A,N/A,N/A,"CIENCIA E TECNICA VITIVINICOLA",1,9,20,12

The aim of this work was to characterize the sensory features of eleven Portuguese natural mineral waters and correlate those with their chemical characteristics. The study of the Piper diagram concluded that the vast majority of these waters have low or very low mineralization content, with total mineralization values not more than 500 mg/L, predominantly sodium bicarbonate or mixed sodium. The sensory analysis was carried out by 10 trained panelists according to ISO 8586:2012 and showed that the tasters were able to distinguish the sensory attributes of the waters, and thus it was possible to establish some correlation between the physical-chemical and sensory parameters. With Principal Component Analysis (PCA), it was possible to explain the percentage of variance between the main chemical components of the studied waters and its sensory characteristics. A significant positive correlation of Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) with HCO3-(0.97), Ca2+ (0.93) and Mg2+ (0.91) was shown, as well as the pH of the natural mineral waters with the salty (0.71) and the sweet (0.69) taste. The sweetest waters were Monchique Chic (3.4) and Monchique (3.3) and the least sweet was Luso. The most acidic were Vitalis (3.4) and Luso (3.3) and the least acidic ones were Monchique Chic (1.9) and Vimeiro Original (1.8). In terms of the salty taste, the most salty samples were Monchique (4.2) with significant differences between all the other samples, and the least salty one was Salutis (1.8).

In addition to the quantity of available water resources, its quality is of extreme importance. The objective of the study was to compare suitability of groundwater with that of surface water in order to use it. An additional goal was to determine the possibility of estimating conservative ion migration time as well as determine nitrate ion migration cycle. Data available from 2015 to 2019 was divided into two groups: ground-water (being under limited influence of climatic conditions and not exposed to direct evaporation) and surface water (exposed to direct sunlight and significant evaporation). It has been shown that, with the exception of nitrate ions, the physicochemical composition of groundwater is less variable than that of surface waters; however, it is strongly spatially diversified across the country. It has been established that in a dry and hot climate, with a high share of artificial irrigation of crops (with deliberate limitation of evaporation and intensification of infiltration) along with the introduction of fertilizers, migration cycle of nitrogen compounds in the environment is different than that from temperate and humid climate. The final conclusion is the unexpected: surface waters are much safer when used for consumption.

Sodium persulphate is a powerful oxidant (Eº = 2.1V). In addition to the direct oxidation that is favored in alkaline media, it can be induced by photolytic processes, catalytic and / or catalytic photos forming sulphate radicals (Eº = 2.6 V) thus providing reaction mechanisms with free radicals like hydroxyl radicals. Methods: In this work the effect of the potassium monopersulphate compound (2KHSO5.KHSO4K2SO4), (Oxone) on the removal of COD in residual water from the biodiesel purification step was tested. Results: The tests, direct oxidation at alkaline pH and catalytic oxidation with cobalt ions, Co(II), showed that the former, for Oxone concentrations of 1.00x10-2 M and 4.00x10-3 M, were not effective because no decomposition occurred, for reaction times over three hours, thus not occurring removal of COD. In the catalytic assays combinations were tested, varying between 5.00x10-3 M and 7.50x10-2 M for the oxidant and 0.10 µM and 1.00 µM for the catalyst. The complete decomposition of the oxidant was always verified between 15 min. and 2 h. The tests with the lowest concentration of cobalt showed COD removal rates around 20% and the highest one reached 60%.

Portugal, however, has one of the highest accident rates in Europe, which raises doubts about the adequate implementation of labor legislation. Methodology: This study analyzes the contents of the training courses offered by several companies, verifying whether they are up to date and relevant to the specific risks of each sector and function of the workers. In addition, the teaching methodologies and the means used to communicate information are evaluated. Results: The study identifies strategies that allow for the delivery of training in occupational health and safety in a differentiated way, aiming at building a more solid safety culture. Discussion: The results indicate that, although there is training in occupational health and safety, it is necessary to better adapt the contents to the specificities of the sectors and ensure that the methodologies are effective in transmitting knowledge. Conclusions: The implementation of differentiated and updated training can significantly contribute to the creation of a robust safety culture and the reduction of workplace accidents in Portugal.","active methodologies ; andragogy ; designated worker, employer representative ; information ; Safety and health at work ; traditional methodologies ; training for workers",0,"Artigos em revista",,Engenharia,Scopus,N/A,"Universidade Nova de Lisboa (Lisbon, Portugal); Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal)",N/A,N/A,"Ana Dias; Carla Santos","0000-0001-5300-2331; 0000-0002-0077-1249",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Among the set of human activities affected stands out the learning process, which was forced to move from a predominantly face-to-face to online format. Additionally, and especially for those who develop social research, this change has added the challenge of adapting the research processes, which, in the social area, are structurally based on the richness of interaction with the object of study, preferably direct and in-person. To understand how such significant changes influenced the learning and research dynamics, a study was developed, with an exploratory and qualitative profile, with students in postgraduate training at a Portuguese Higher Education Institution. For this purpose, were collected, online in two different time periods, descriptive narratives of their opinion on the effects of the experienced situation. The thematic categorical content analysis carried out, with the exploratory complement of the T-LAB software, allowed to conclude that for the students, in analysis, the situation had a negative influence on the processes of learning and research development. The breach of full social experience forced very individualized and much more demanding learning and research paths in terms of organization, motivation, and personal resilience. Added to this greater demand are the difficulties felt in matching the academic work with the family life, and, above all, with the collateral effects of fear and/or sadness resulting from the maintenance of the pandemic situation for so long.","COVID-19 ; Effects on Learning ; Effects on social research ; Higher Education ; Postgraduate training",1,"Artigos em revista",,"Ciências Empresariais",Scopus,N/A,"Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal)",N/A,N/A,"Sandra Saúde; Ana Isabel Rodrigues","0000-0003-0935-1133; 0000-0001-9140-9722",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

On the other hand, it is also verified that the periods of rain occur in a shorter interval, although more intensively. Water scarcity is one of the major challenges reflected in the UN 6th Sustainable Development Goal. Higher Education Institutions (HEIs), as places of responsibility in preparing future leaders, must have strong sustainability policies, namely through the implementation of water efficiency measures on their campi. The main aim of this work was to evaluate water consumption and the good practices that the different HEIs have implemented on their campi to improve and promote green and sustainable behaviors, and to calculate water efficiency indicators associated with each HEI. The data were collected through a survey completed by eight HEIs distributed throughout the country. The results show that some institutions have already been implementing measures for water efficiency and have developed some activities with the academic and surrounding community. The range of values calculated for the indicators is large and there is not a strong correlation between them. Per capita consumption values vary between 1.8 and 23.5 L/(person·day), the differences being explained mostly by campus characteristics, namely: green areas; water sources for irrigation; age of buildings; and the existence of facilities on campus such as residences and sports facilities. Nevertheless, the consumption per capita values are generally lower than those found in the literature for equivalent institutions. Given the growing concern with water scarcity, sharing this kind of information among institutions may contribute to improving water efficiency.","higher education institutions ; SDG ; sustainability ; water efficiency ; water use",4,"Artigos em revista",3035,Engenharia,Ambas,"RCS  Royal College of Surgeons of England","CERIS – Civil Engineering Research and Innovation for Sustainability (Lisbon, Portugal); School of Technology and Management (Leiria, Portugal); University of Évora (Evora, Portugal); Instituto Superior de Engenharia de Lisboa (Lisbon, Portugal); Universidade de Coimbra, Instituto de Engenharia de Sistemas E Computadores de Coimbra (Coimbra, Portugal); Instituto Politécnico de Tomar (Tomar, Portugal); Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal); University of Trás-os-Montes and Alto Douro (Vila Real, Portugal); CIIMAR - Interdisciplinary Centre of Marine and Environmental Research (Matosinhos, Portugal); Instituto Politécnico de Viana do Castelo (Viana do Castelo, Portugal); Instituto Superior Técnico (Lisbon, Portugal); ARNET—Aquatic Research Network (Braga, Portugal)",N/A,N/A,"Ana M.

The tests were carried out in models of 2 beds with a surface of 0.24 m2 and depth 0.70 m each at various hydraulic loads (HL) and COD constant in influente wastewater. The VFCW-1 bed was planted with the Vetiveria zizanioides and the VFCW-2 bed with the Oryza sativa. During the 22 weeks of research, the hydraulic load of the analyzed beds was: HL1 = 148 dm3·m−2·d−1, HL2 = 239 dm3·m−2·d−1, HL3 = 350 dm3·m−2·d−1, HL4 = 473 dm3·m−2·d−1. The VFCWs were fed from two reservoirs, one with mineral medium and nitrate, and the other one with fructose as organic matter. Based on the conducted tests, it was found that in both analyzed systems (VFCW-1 and VFCW-2) the highest NO3−-N removal rate was found under HL2 – the median is 59 and 42% respectively. The most effective removal of COD in the VFCW-1 system was obtained at a HL2 – 55%, while in the system VFCW-2 at a HL1 – 43%. The research shows that the low HL and high COD/NO3−-N ratio ensures good effects of nitrate and organic matter removal in VF type constructed wetland systems. It has been shown that the analyzed plants, especially Vetiveria zizanioides have good phytoremediation potential in the field of nitrate nitrogen and organic substance removal and can be recommended for use on a full scale of technology.","COD ; Constructed wetland ; Nitrate nitrogen ; Oryza sativa ; Vertical flow ; Vetiveria zizanioides",27,"Artigos em revista",,Engenharia,Ambas,N/A,"University of Life Sciences in Lublin (Lublin, Poland); Uniwersytet Rolniczy im.

In the Alentejo region (southern Portugal) the irrigated area has grown since the completion of the Alqueva dam in 2002. Climatic change patterns foreseen for the Mediterranean region (more heat extremes, less precipitation and river flow, increasing risk of droughts and decrease in crop yields) are prone to soil salinization and sodification in irrigated areas in the region. The Roxo dam has some of the higher records of water salinity and sodicity in Portugal, which makes the Roxo irrigated area (RIA) a very interesting case study. This paper aimed at two main objectives for the RIA: (i) evaluate soil salinization and sodification, and make spatial predictions of soils susceptibility to these degradation types; (ii) monitor current salinity and sodicity of the water, and simulate the effect of empirical based scenarios of water salinity and sodicity. The RIA (8250 ha) extends ~20 km along the Roxo river (northern Aljustrel), in Cenozoic sedimentary formations. Main soils mapped are: Luvisols (~40%), Fluvisols and Regosols (~20%), Gleysols and Planosols (~20%) and Vertisols (~10%). However, there are only five soil profiles with detailed analytical data from a more recent soil survey with 83 profile descriptions in the RIA and surrounding area. Irrigation water of the Roxo dam and drainage water of the Roxo river were monitored almost monthly during Jul/2014-Nov/2015 and Jun/2016-Jan/2017, for determination of electrical conductivity (EC), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), and other parameters. Soil salinity was not a significant problem in the RIA but a potential abundance of sodic soils was found that need future confirmation. A qualitative soil salinity index applied to the RIA suggests that soils most susceptible to salinity occur to a much smaller extent when this index is obtained from the soil profile data (approach B) than when it is based on information of the soil map (approach A). During the monitoring periods, both the water of the Roxo dam and of the Roxo river were slight to moderate saline for crop growth, with no restrictions for soil infiltration. The Roxo dam received water from the Alqueva dam for the first time between June and September 2016, and a small, though regular, decrease of the water EC (0.99 to 0.76 dS m-1) was observed during the same period. Three scenarios of irrigation water, identified by Low/High EC-SAR (L-L, H-H, L-H) were simulated with the Watsuit model. Low EC water (L-L and L-H) represent wet years and show no risk of soil salinity in the rootzone. However, the risk of waterlogging increases in sodic soils, especially with the scenario (L-H). High EC water (H-H) represents dryer years and results in severe saline conditions in the rootzone. In all three scenarios, prosodic and sodic soils are most sensible to degradation by salinization, sodification or both.","Alentejo ; Electrical conductivity ; SAR ; Water quality ; Waterlogging",18,"Artigos em revista",,Engenharia,Ambas,N/A,"University of Évora (Evora, Portugal); Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal)",N/A,N/A,"Carlos Alexandre; Teresa Borralho; Anabela Durão","0000-0002-4867-0973; N/A; 0000-0001-9069-2554",N/A,N/A,N/A,"SPANISH JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE",1,102,120,19

In this work, the water footprint (WFP) in the wine sector was evaluated, from the vineyard to the bottle, through the implementation of a methodology based on field experiments and life cycle assessment (LCA) on two Portuguese case studies. Regarding direct water footprint, it ranged from 366 to 899 L/FU (0.75 L bottle), with green water being the most significant component, representing more than 50% of the overall water footprint. The approach used in the current study revealed that although more than 97.5% of the water footprint is associated with vineyard, the winery stage is responsible for more than 75% of the global warming potential indicator. A linear correlation between the carbon footprint and the indirect blue water footprint was also observed for both case studies.

Food production chain is considered one of the main waste producers. Therefore, several studies on its by-products and waste valorization have been carried out, producing a wide range of secondary raw materials. Membrane technologies are increasingly used for the recovery of valuable compounds such as fibers, pectin, sugars, proteins and phenolic compounds from agroindustrial waste. In Mediterranean countries olive oil, wine and cheese production chains are of special interest, having an important economic and social impact in these countries, often associated with the production of high quality products, such as the PDO (Protected Designation of Origin) olive oils and cheeses and the VQPRD (Quality Wines Produced in Demarcated Wine Region) wines. The current chapter gives an overview regarding nanofiltration (NF) application for recovering high added-value compounds from the above mentioned agroindustrial by-products and waste streams. For example, in cheese making production, NF has been recently used to recover the components of cheese whey ultrafiltration (UF) permeates of a molecular weight lower than 1000 Da, aiming for its selective separation, concentration and/or demineralization, with advantages over other techniques. Compared with reverse osmosis it enables an energy saving of 20 to 45%, due to the use of lower transmembrane pressures. NF technology has also been lately examined to recover valuable antioxidant compounds from the wastes of olive oil industry, particularly low-molecular-weight polyphenolic compounds from olive mill wastewater.

Three commercial membranes with similar cut-off (10kDa), made from different hydrophilic materials: RC70PP (cellulose regenerated acetate), ETNA10PP (composite fluoro polymer) and UFX10pHt (polysulphone permanently hydrophilic) were tested. The performance of the three membranes was studied in terms of permeate fluxes, reversible and irreversible fouling resistances, water recovery fluxes and rejection factors.

Permeation experiments were carried out at different transmembrane pressures and cross-flow velocities, for studying the influence of these operating conditions on permeate fluxes. The modeling of ultrafiltration was performed in terms of permeate fluxes adjusting the resistances-in-series model. The results showed that the M1 allows higher permeate fluxes and displays the conventional pattern of linear variation of permeate fluxes with transmembrane pressure for lower pressures. With membranes M2 there is a linear variation of permeate fluxes with transmembrane pressure in all the pressure range and for the three feed circulation velocities studied. The membrane M3 has the lowest permeate fluxes and shows for the two higher feed circulation velocities (0.94. m/s and 1.23. m/s) a linear variation of permeate fluxes with transmembrane pressure, in all the pressure range studied. The modeling of ultrafiltration allowed to conclude that with the membranes M1, the concentration polarization controls the mass transfer in all the pressure range studied, whereas the resistance due to fouling is the main contributor for lowering the permeate fluxes, with the membranes M2 and M3.Once the membranes M1 allow higher permeate fluxes and better selectivity with a negligible contribution of fouling, in the experimental conditions used, they are more suitable for the ultrafiltration of pretreated ovine cheese whey. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Concentration polarization ; Fouling ; Ovine cheese whey ; Ultrafiltration",42,"Artigos em revista",,"Tecnologias CAplicadas",Ambas,"FCT (SFRH/BD/50227/2009) Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia","Instituto de Ciencia e Engenharia de Materials Superficies (Lisbon, Portugal); Instituto Superior de Agronomia, Universidade de Lisboa (Lisbon, Portugal); Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal)",N/A,N/A,"Antonia Macedo; Elizabeth Duarte; Maria Pinho","N/A; 0000-0002-6378-0564",N/A,N/A,N/A,"JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE",1-2,34,40,7

The SCW is processed by NF to recover a rich lactose fraction in the concentrate and a process water with a high salt content in the permeate. The permeation experiments were carried out in a plate and frame NF unit, where two NF membranes (NFT50 and HR-95-PP) were characterized and tested. The NF permeation experiments were performed accordingly with two different operation modes: total recirculation and concentration. In order to select the best membrane and operating pressure for the SCW fractionation, total recirculation experiments were carried out. After the membrane selection, the concentration experiments showed that the selected membrane (NFT50) at 30 bar allows a water recovery of approximately 80%, concentrating the second cheese whey nutrients approximately 5 times.

Although the literature on inequality focuses heavily on income inequality, inequality encompasses economic, social, and spatial dimensions, being relevant in different fields of society. When addressing inequality, the measure that immediately appears as a candidate for evaluating this inequality is the Gini index, however, there are several circumstances in which other measures of inequality are more appropriate, or in which the information provided by the Gini index is insufficient to adequately characterize or compare inequality. Considering that, in certain situations, the Variance-to-Mean Ratio and the Gini Index appear as viable alternatives to measure inequality, we are interested in analyzing the Variance-to-Mean Ratio regarding its compliance with the four basic criteria for inequality measures, adopting a formal and axiomatic approach.

Historically, the Gini coefficient has mainly been used to study income or wealth distributions, but, as highlighted by Gini himself, the coefficient's power to measure inequality extends to other contexts. In order to adapt it to the needs and points of view of those who use it, both in its classical and non-traditional applications, the Gini coefficient is frequently modified and extended, which resulted in a multitude of mathematical expressions, interpretations and generalizations of this coefficient. The so-called True Gini coefficient, one of the multiple formulations of the Gini coefficient for discrete distributions that can be found in the literature, is a correction of the Gini coefficient that is directly derived from the mean difference between n quantities, originally proposed by Gini, in 1912, and follows from the exclusion of self-on-self differences in the calculation. References to the main motivation for using the Gini coefficient point to its good properties, however, the fulfilment of the criteria for inequality measures is not common to the different formulations of the Gini coefficient. In this work we assessed the fulfillment of the four basic criteria for inequality measures by the True Gini coefficient, having shown that this formulation of the coefficient fulfills the principle of transfers, symmetry, and scale invariance.

Based on the structure of the variance-covariance matrix, emerged a special class of linear mixed models, those of models with orthogonal block structure, which allows optimal estimation for variance components of blocks and contrasts of treatments. This approach triggered a more restrict class of mixed models, models with commutative orthogonal block structure, whose interest lies in the possibility of achieving least squares estimators giving best linear unbiased estimators for estimable vectors. Exploring the possibility of joint analysis of linear mixed models, obtained independently, and focusing on the approach based on the algebraic structure of the models, some authors have investigated the conditions in which the good properties of the estimators are preserved. In this work we intend to highlight the ideas underlying the techniques for the joint analysis of models, since these aspects were under-explored in the works where the theoretical formulation of the techniques were introduced. Given that these techniques were developed involving models with commutative orthogonal block structure, we provide a selective review of the literature focusing on the contributions addressing this special class of mixed linear models.","Commutative orthogonal block structure ; Models crossing ; Models joining ; Models nesting",1,"Artigos em conferência",,"Matemática CFisicas",Scopus,"FCT (UIDB/00297/2020) Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia","Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia da Universidade Nova de Lisboa (Caparica, Portugal); Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal); Universidade da Beira Interior (Covilha, Portugal)",N/A,N/A,"Carla Santos; Cristina Dias; Célia Nunes; João Tiago Mexia","N/A; 0000-0002-0077-1249",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Internal variables considered include credit quality, capital adequacy, management quality, financial margin, and bank size, alongside an external variable, the Euribor. The findings reveal that credit risk, capital adequacy, management capacity, and Euribor are the most statistically significant for both return on equity and return on assets, with Euribor emerging as the greatest statistically significant variable.

Profitability has been a persistent challenge for banks since the global financial crisis. Moreover, the Portuguese banking system had been facing several structural problems, which makes this topic particularly relevant. The profitability proxy used is the return on equity (ROE). The empirical strategy followed was pooled OLS. Variables relevant for explaining Portuguese banks' profitability are capital adequacy, liquidity and credit risk.

This game includes 3 different activities which can be played in any order: solid waste recycling, saving water, and saving electricity. A small group of people evaluated the games; all participants were familiar with video games. It should be noted that the tests carried out focused only on the usability and interactivity of the game - the impact of the game at the 3Rs level - Reduce, Reuse and Recycle - has not been tested yet. The game makes the user more aware of the physical space where he moves (the school), showing his progress in real time.

PBL is a widely known approach that aims to improve motivation and learning by engaging students in investigation with the aim of building a product, solving a problem, or both. Moreover, many studies claim that PBL significantly improves soft skills. This work describes the adaptation of two lower level short-cycle tertiary education programs, in programming and computer engineering, to achieve PBL goals. Qualitative and quantitative studies were carried out in two steps: 1) focus groups with students and instructors and 2) surveys to students that completed an internship and to the respective employers. The intention was to identify the extent to which instructors and students had adopted the new practices and to assess the respective results, as well as to collect employers' opinions about the students' skills and abilities after attending the PBL adapted program. The results of this study showed the need to improve the teaching practices to achieve PBL goals, mainly on soft skills acquisition. We propose recommendations based on two dimensions: institution and instructors. We conclude that the adoption of curriculum innovation at the program level implies a huge commitment from all stakeholders, as well the institution as a whole. In addition, we identify the benefits and difficulties of using PBL regarding motivation, group work, leadership, adaptation, communication, and implementation of more realistic projects.","Curricula ; Higher Education ; PBL ; Qualitative and Quantitative Studies ; Soft-Skills",2,"Artigos em conferência",9125297,Engenharia,Ambas,(UID/EEA/00066/2019),"Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal); Instituto de Desenvolvimento de Novas Tecnologias (Caparica, Portugal)",N/A,N/A,"Isabel Sofia Brito; Joao Paulo Barros; Elsa Rodrigues","N/A; 0000-0001-8445-6651",N/A,N/A,N/A,"PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2020 IEEE GLOBAL ENGINEERING EDUCATION CONFERENCE (EDUCON 2020)",,1614,1621,8

The objective is to know if there are differences in the value of technical efficiency (TE) by applying different estimation methods. In the energy sector, over the recent decades, many studies have been published that analyse firms’ performance, using as a measure of technical efficiency the estimated values from parametric and non-parametric methods. In the literature there is no study that addresses whether different estimation methods can influence the value obtained for TE. The analysis of these factors is an important instrument for performance evaluation, by enabling firms to adopt more precise lines and benchmarking techniques. The data consist of 162 models, reporting on 63 scientific articles which empirically analyze the level of efficiency and productivity in the energy sector, from 1979 to 2013. The meta-regression model enables an understanding of the effects that different specifications of the models may have on the estimated values for efficiency. The results identify positive and negative effects on efficiency, but the most important is that neither method is preferable to the other.","Data Envelopment Analysis ; Meta-Analysis ; Stochastic Frontiers",1,"Artigos em conferência",,"Ciências Empresariais",Scopus,N/A,"Instituto Politécnico de Tomar (Tomar, Portugal); Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal); Ci2 - Smart Cities Research Center - IP Tomar (Tomar, Portugal)",N/A,N/A,"Olinda Sequeira; Fernando Teixeira","0000-0002-0868-6532; 0000-0001-6306-8000",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Aims: To analyze the frequency with which futile nursing interventions are implemented in critically ill patients admitted to adult intensive care in specific situations and how often futile autonomous and interdependent nursing interventions are implemented in the same population, as perceived by adult intensive care nurses. Research design: Cross-sectional, quantitative, and descriptive study, which employed a questionnaire constructed specifically for this research to assess the perception of therapeutic futility in nursing in adult intensive care. Following an evaluation of the psychometric properties, the questionnaire was made available in an electronic format on the EUSurvey platform between August and October 2024. The data was analyzed between November 2023 and March 2024 using the statistical software packages SPSS and R. Participants and research context: A simple random sample of nurses working in level II and level III intensive care units in Portugal. Ethical considerations: Research ethical approvals were obtained, and the participants provided informed consent. Findings/results: Four hundred and fourteen valid questionnaires were obtained. The results allow the identification of thirty-three statistically significant associations, the inference of intervals for the mean and median for the perception of futility of nursing interventions with a 95% confidence interval, and enable the hierarchization of nursing interventions implemented in critically ill patients admitted to adult intensive care units according to the nurses’ perception of their futility. Conclusion: There is a balance in nurses' perception of the futility of their interventions in the specific situations analyzed. There is statistically significant evidence that interdependent nursing interventions are, in general, more frequently perceived as futile when compared to autonomous nursing interventions.","Critical care ; intensive care ; medical futility ; nursing ; nursing care",0,"Artigos em revista",,Engenharia,Ambas,"FCT (UIDB/04279/2020) Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia","University of Évora (Evora, Portugal); Instituto de Telecomunicações (Aveiro, Portugal); Universidade Católica Portuguesa (Lisbon, Portugal)",N/A,N/A,"João Vítor Vieira; Henrique Oliveira; Sérgio Deodato; Felismina Mendes","0000-0002-3905-4802; N/A; 0000-0001-8687-4291",N/A,N/A,N/A,"NURSING ETHICS",,,,19

Confirmatory factor analysis was used to infer the reliability and construct validity of the proposed model, involving three latent factors: functional capacity, quality of life, and patient satisfaction with nursing care received. The proposed model showed good reliability and construct validity, although it failed regarding discriminant validity between latent factors. The greatest statistically significant predictor of the patient satisfaction latent factor was the quality of life latent factor (β= 0.89 ; p< 0.001), followed by the functional capacity latent factor (β= - 0.77 ; p< 0.001).

This paper proposes a simple system to help speed up road pavement surface inspection and its analysis towards making maintenance decisions. A low-cost video camera mounted on a vehicle was used to capture pavement imagery, which was fed to an automatic crack detection and classification system based on deep neural networks. The system provided two types of output: (i) a cracking percentage per road segment, providing an alert to areas that require attention from the experts; (ii) a segmentation map highlighting which areas of the road pavement surface are affected by cracking. With this data, it became possible to select which maintenance or rehabilitation processes the road pavement required. The system achieved promising results in the analysis of highway pavements, and being automated and having a low processing time, the system is expected to be an effective aid for experts dealing with road pavement maintenance.","characterization of highways condition ; crack classification ; crack segmentation ; deep neural networks",1,"Artigos em revista",1701,Engenharia,Ambas,"FCT (UIDB/50008/2020) Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia","Instituto de Telecomunicações (Aveiro, Portugal); Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal); Instituto Superior Técnico (Lisbon, Portugal)",N/A,N/A,"Diogo Inácio; Henrique Oliveira; Pedro Oliveira; Paulo Correia","N/A; 0000-0001-8687-4291; 0000-0001-6525-9572",N/A,N/A,N/A,"REMOTE SENSING",6,,,21

Methodology: Longitudinal and retrospective study, through analysis of the electronic health records in the GestCare platform of the National Network of Integrated Continued Care in Portugal: Convalescence Units (CU), Medium Term and Rehabilitation Units (MDRU), Long Term and Maintenance Units (ULDM), between 1 January 2008 and 27 February 2017, with a total of 171 414 individuals and multiple assessments of health status. Results: Older age (85 years or more), not having attended school, low body mass index, presence of sad or depressed mood were predictive factors for greater deficits in mobility, in activities of daily living, instrumental activities and cognitive status. In the CU the percentile of severe dependence is more likely in women from 88 years of age and in men from 91 years of age. In the MDRU the profile of severe dependence occurs more likely from the age of 75 for men and 80 years of age for women. In the LTMU it is processed from the 81 years.

The landscape’s complexity, mainly due to severe shadows cast by the wild vegetation and trees, makes it challenging to extract rural roads based on processing aerial or satellite images, leading to heterogeneous results. This article proposes a method to improve the automatic detection of rural roads and the extraction of their centerlines from aerial images. This method has two main stages: (i) the use of a deep learning model (DeepLabV3+) for predicting rural road segments; (ii) an optimization strategy to improve the connections between predicted rural road segments, followed by a morphological approach to extract the rural road centerlines using thinning algorithms, such as those proposed by Zhang–Suen and Guo–Hall. After completing these two stages, the proposed method automatically detected and extracted rural road centerlines from complex rural environments. This is useful for developing real-time mapping applications.","centerline extraction ; convolutional neural network (CNN) ; decision support system (DSS) ; deep learning ; forest fires ; geographic information system (GIS) ; rural roads ; spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) ; wireless sensor networks (WSN)",6,"Artigos em revista",271,Engenharia,Ambas,"CTS (PCIF/SSI/0102/2017) Canadian Thoracic Society","Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia da Universidade Nova de Lisboa (Caparica, Portugal); Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal); Instituto de Desenvolvimento de Novas Tecnologias (Caparica, Portugal); Telecommunications Institute (Lisbon, Portugal)",N/A,N/A,"Miguel Lourenço; Diogo Estima; Henrique Oliveira; Luís Oliveira; André Mora","0000-0001-5767-3394; 0000-0001-5150-6421; 0000-0001-8687-4291; N/A; 0000-0003-1354-4739",N/A,N/A,N/A,"REMOTE SENSING",1,,,20

Methods: Longitudinal study with a population of 59,013 older adults (65 years or older) hospitalized in Medium-Term Care and Rehabilitation Units in Portugal. Results: Older age (≥85 years), no school attendance, low body mass index and presence of sad or depressed mood were predictive factors for a deficit in functional capacity. We identified significant improvements in rehabilitation, but after 210 days of hospitalization, older people incurred a loss of functionality. Total compensation needs were typified by severe deficits in self-care and functional capacity: 47.1%. A moderate deficit was present in 43.1%, and a slight self-care and functional deficit occurred in 9.8% of the individuals.

Methods: This was a cross-sectional study with a sample of 351 elderly citizens (46.4% males and 53.6% females) randomly selected from the official dataset of the Local Health Unit of Baixo Alentejo. All the data were collected by health professionals at the participants’ homes following the structured interview methodology and using the WHOQOL-BREF(PT) instrument. Three different structural equation models were developed: (i) a first-order confirmatory factor analysis, to assess the instrument’s psychometric properties; (ii) a hierarchical second-order confirmatory factor analysis model, to allow determining the QOL24 scoring; and (iii) a more generic structural equation model, to investigate the correlation level between QOL24 and the instrument’s general facet. Results: The WHOQOL-BREF(PT) showed an “almost very good” goodness of fit (comparative fit index of 0.949 and Tucker-Lewis index of 0.943), an adequate internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha: from 0.64 to 0.90; composite reliability: from 0.59 to 0.88) and tolerable convergent validity (average variance extracted: from 0.374 to 0.614). However, discriminant validity was not reached because strong correlations between the first-order factors (four QOL domains) were obtained, together with low values of the average variance extracted. The scoring of QOL domains and QOL24, determined as weighted averages (proposed in this article as novelty) were significantly different than those determined as unweighted averages. The standardized correlation coefficient between QOL24 and the instrument’s general facet was of 0.89 (statistically highly significant). Conclusions: The WHOQOL-BREF(PT) is a psychometrically sound instrument to assess the QOL of the considered population sample. However, the QOL domains were found strongly intertwined.

To improve image’s resolution, a new super-resolution algorithm, named KGEONP – K Geographically Nearest Pixels, is proposed in this paper. It benefits from Sentinel-2 regular observations (it has a revisit of 5 days) and the georeferencing error of its images (whose maximum value is 1.5 pixels). KGEONP seeks to add as much information as possible to the super-resolved image, by using data from K-nearest pixels and their spatial distance for computing each new pixel’s value. KGEONP was applied to Sentinel-2 images to increase resolution by a factor of 10 and was compared to state-of-the-art super-resolution techniques.

Images of road pavement surface can be automatically processed, typically employing segmentation algorithms to identify cracks. However, a set of distinct connected components often result, leading to the detection of several independent crack segments, although they may belong to the same pavement surface defect. This is often observed for cracks that exhibit a longer linear development or present several branches. This paper presents a new strategy to identify cracks on images captured during road pavement surveys, even when those cracks appear with a complex shape. The proposed crack segmentation algorithm includes two stages: (i) selection of prominent ""crack seeds"", adopting an efficient segmentation procedure, after appropriate image smoothing, minimizing the detection of false positives; (ii) iterative binary pixel classification, into the crack or non-crack classes, extending the ""seeds"" to identify the complete crack shape. The paper also tests the combination of the proposed two stage crack segmentation with three smoothing techniques, to evaluate their suitability for crack detection. As a final step the system classifies the identified cracks as longitudinal, transversal or miscellaneous types. Tests performed with images acquired from different types of sensors (active and non-active), show improved crack segmentation results.","Crack Detection ; Image Processing ; Pattern Recognition ; Road Surface ; Segmentation",37,"Artigos em conferência",8081565,Engenharia,Scopus,N/A,"Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal); Instituto Superior Técnico (Lisbon, Portugal)",N/A,N/A,"Henrique Oliveira; Paulo Lobato Correia","N/A; 0000-0001-8687-4291",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Indeed, population growth is one of the main causes for this deficit. The protection and sustainable consumption of water is one of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, to ensure that the world’s population has access to clean water, free from pollution and managed responsibly. Thus, governments and non-governmental organizations must promote the conscious and informed use of water by the population.

These compounds are not removed by biological treatment in wastewater treatment plants and they may affect the removal of ammonium, nitrate, organic nitrogen by these treatment systems. Therefore, this research proposes a new and innovative low-cost and easy-to-apply pre-treatment to treat low biodegradable and high nitrogen wastewaters, using explosive wastewaters as case study. The pre-treatment is composed by immediate one-step lime precipitation (IOSLM) and atmospheric CO2 carbonation (AC) processes. The novelty of the proposed pre-treatment is based firstly on the use of one reactant (hydrated lime) at high concentrations, added in one step, that produces immediately an abundant and insoluble precipitate able to sweep the organic matter and other contaminants from wastewater in a short time and ensure conditions (pH and Ca2+) for the AC process.

Filter methods, which assess features using statistical metrics, are particularly notable. Recently, a novel metric called Conditional Dependence Coefficient has been proposed to measure the dependence between subsets of variables.This paper introduces a novel filter feature selection method that integrates the Conditional Dependence Coefficient metric with an evolutionary algorithm to find the optimal feature subset. This approach combines the adaptability of genetic algorithms with the strength of an intuitive metric. Unlike many filter-based methods, our technique does not rely on parameters directly linked to the number of features (like thresholds). Moreover, it evaluates the collective merit of feature subsets rather than individual significance.We conducted tests on six different multivariate time-series datasets to address the forecasting challenge, determining the relevant lags. Considering no selection as baseline, experimental results indicate that our approach is competitive in terms of efficacy while demonstrating a reduction in the number of features selected.","feature selection ; genetic algorithm ; machine learning ; regression ; time-series forecasting",1,"Artigos em conferência",,Engenharia,Ambas,"MCIN (PID2020-117954RBC22/AEI/10.13039/501100011033) Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación","Universidad de Sevilla (Sevilla, Spain); Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal); Instituto de Desenvolvimento de Novas Tecnologias (Caparica, Portugal)",N/A,N/A,"Maria Lourdes Linares-Barrera; Manuel J.

This paper focused on how the agile teams dealt with the challenges of WFH and how this affected the software development process. To capture the perceptions of the agile teams, we carried out a survey that investigated the following aspects of WFH: work routine, collaboration, communication, productivity, transparency, challenges, and the software development process itself. The survey received 127 valid responses from agile team members and the results revealed that i) most of the members of agile teams considered the work continued as usual regardless of the place (office or remote); ii) 80% of members of agile teams mentioned an increase in productivity during WFH; iii) 85% of participants are using Scrum as management strategy; iv) communication between teams members during the remote working model was perceived as more effective; v) Microsoft Teams and Google Meets were the most used interactions tools by members of agile teams.","Agile Software Development ; Communication ; Interaction ; Productivity ; Working from Home",1,"Artigos em conferência",,Engenharia,Scopus,"CAPES  Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior","Universidade de Brasília (Brasilia, Brazil); Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal); University Hospital of Brasilia (Brasilia, Brazil)",N/A,N/A,"Edna Dias Canedo; Angelica Toffano Seidel Calazans; Geovana Ramos Sousa Silva; Isabel Sofia Brito; Eloisa Toffano Seidel Masson","0000-0002-2159-339X; 0000-0002-2783-4473; 0000-0002-0304-0804; 0000-0002-7556-4367; 0000-0002-0409-058X",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Therefore, it is important to change the way we develop software to address the challenges posed by sustainability. Our goal is to contribute with a reusable sustainability requirements catalogue that helps developers be aware of sustainability-related properties worth considering during software development. The information for this catalogue was gathered via a systematic mapping study, whose results were synthesised in feature models and then modelled using iStar for a more expressive and configurable representation. A qualitative evaluation of the catalogue's readability, interest, utility, and usefulness by 50 participants from the domain, showed that around 79% of the respondents found the catalogue “Good” or “Very Good”. However, more than 5% of the expert participants found weaknesses regarding most of the evaluated questions and around 25% are neutral in their overall evaluation. This led us to evolve the initial version of the catalogue for the social and technical dimensions of sustainability to improve its completeness and usefulness. This is achieved by aligning the information gathered in the systematic mapping study with the well-established quality model of the ISO/IEC 25010:2011, as we expect most of the experts are familiar with those qualities and respective hierarchies. During this process, we found information that led us to propose two additional qualities that were not covered by the ISO standard: fairness and legislation. We applied this evolved version of the catalogue to the U-Bike project comparing the requirements elicited without the catalogue with those identified using the catalogue. The result suggests that new sustainability requirements were worth considering from a sustainability point of view, supporting the usefulness of the catalogue.","Quality attributes (or qualities) ; Sustainability requirements catalogue ; Sustainability requirements modelling",4,"Artigos em revista",102107,Engenharia,Ambas,"NOVA LINCS (UIDB/04516/2020) NOVA Laboratory for Computer Science and Informatics","Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia da Universidade Nova de Lisboa (Caparica, Portugal); Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal); Instituto de Desenvolvimento de Novas Tecnologias (Caparica, Portugal)",N/A,N/A,"Ana Moreira; João Araújo; Catarina Gralha; Miguel Goulão; Isabel Sofia Brito; Diogo Albuquerque","N/A; 0000-0002-7556-4367",N/A,N/A,N/A,"DATA & KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING",,,,16

Their potential has been particularly remarkable in unstructured data, but recently developed architectures or their ensemble with other classical methods have produced competitive results in structured data. Feature selection has several beneficial properties: improve efficacy, performance, problem understanding and data recollection time. However, as new data sources become available and new features are generated using feature engineering techniques, more computational resources are required for feature selection methods. Feature selection takes an exorbitant amount of time in datasets with numerous features, making it impossible to use or achieving suboptimal selections that do not reflect the underlying behavior of the problem. We propose a nonparametric neural network layer which provides all the benefits of feature selection while requiring few changes to the architecture. Our method adds a novel layer at the beginning of the neural network, which removes the influence of features during training, adding inherent interpretability to the model without extra parameterization. In contrast to other feature selection methods, we propose an efficient and model-aware method to select the features with no need to train the model several times.

To properly address sustainability, its various dimensions need to be reasoned about and their impact on each other and on other system concerns studied from the very early stages of software development. To this purpose, we present a concern-oriented requirements approach that allows both, modeling sustainability concepts and their relationships, and managing conflicting situations triggered by impacts among sustainability dimensions or between those and other system concerns. To tackle the complexity of conflict management, a rigorous trade-off analysis technique based on multi-criteria decision making methods is used to rank, stakeholders and effects between concerns' responsibilies.

It was motivated by sporadic criticism by some students regarding the use of 'non-professional' tools. All the inquired students had already attended an introductory computer programming course (CS1) where the library was used. We used a student-focused approach, based on an anonymous questionnaire and semi-structured interviews, to obtain information about the students' opinions and perceptions related to the use of the library. In order to avoid contamination regarding the opinion about 'non-professional' tools, students were also asked about the use of BlueJ IDE. The interviews were conducted after the follow-up programming course, where a professional IDE was used, thus allowing students to express a more informed opinion on the relative merits, for novices, of each IDE. Our results clearly point to a large positive opinion about the use of the BlueJ environment, but less so about the library. Most students do not like the use of graphics as they lack the needed mathematical background, namely Cartesian geometry and simple trigonometry, but would approve the use of the library in part of the semester without the geometry component.","BlueJ ; CS1 ; IDE ; Introductory programming ; Java ACM ; Novices ; Pedagogy",0,"Artigos em conferência",7943031,Engenharia,Scopus,N/A,"Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal); Instituto de Desenvolvimento de Novas Tecnologias (Caparica, Portugal)",N/A,N/A,"Joao Paulo Barros; Isabel Sofia Brito","N/A; 0000-0002-7556-4367",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

This trend has been even more evident in some regions where the preservation of natural resources is of utmost importance, not only from an environmental perspective, but also from an economic one. In this context, technology has become one of the key factors to achieve sustainability goals. An example of these technologies are Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) which are being used more and more with sustainability purposes. However, although some efforts have been made to propose software approaches to model sustainability, some examples that model the impact of technology on sustainability are still needed. This paper presents an instance of a sustainability metamodel for the UAVs domain. This model allows to specify the impact of UAV-based processes on sustainability, and also to identify potential limitations that may hinder its applicability.

In addition, the effects of aspect-oriented (AO) mechanisms on the entire development process need to be better assessed rather than just analysing each development phase in isolation. As such, this paper outlines our initial effort on the design of a testbed that will provide end-to-end systematic comparison of AOSD techniques with other mainstream modularisation techniques. This will allow the proponents of AO and non-AO techniques to compare their approaches in a consistent manner.

Therefore, mathematical models become more realistic if distinct evaluation aspects, such as cost and environmental concerns, are explicitly considered as objective functions rather than being encompassed by a single economic indicator. With the aid of multiple objective models, decision makers may grasp the conflicting nature and the trade-offs among the different objectives in order to select satisfactory compromise solutions. This paper presents a multiple objective mixed integer linear programming model for power generation expansion planning that allows the consideration of modular expansion capacity values of supply-side options. This characteristic of the model avoids the well-known problem associated with continuous capacity values that usually have to be discretized in a post-processing phase without feedback on the nature and importance of the changes in the attributes of the obtained solutions. Demand-side management (DSM) is also considered an option in the planning process, assuming there is a sufficiently large portion of the market under franchise conditions. As DSM full costs are accounted in the model, including lost revenues, it is possible to perform an evaluation of the rate impact in order to further inform the decision process. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

It is ripened traditionally in rooms with empirical control of temperature and humidity. Nowadays, almost all cheese factories use rooms with temperature and humidity control, but still a significant heterogeneity among cheeses is acknowledged due to unequal distribution of environmental conditions. This paper discusses the influence of the environmental conditions on the ripening of Queijo de Évora, including the application of computational fluid dynamics in steady state conditions. Experimental data was obtained in cheeses ripened along the traditional ripening cycle, in different locations. A significant influence of environmental conditions was observed, especially air velocity and humidity, affecting physical–chemical, microbiological and sensory characteristics. Locations with higher air velocity, presented cheeses with lower moisture content, higher mesophilic bacteria count, darker appearance and higher number of holes. Locations with higher humidity presented cheeses with lower scores on some sensorial parameters like appearance, firmness and intensity of odor. The results of computational fluid dynamics made possible the identification of areas in and around the cheese stacks were the air distribution is less than adequate or uneven, which may influence the evolution of cheese during ripening.","CFD ; Cheese ; Queijo de évora ; Ripening ; Sensorial",9,"Artigos em revista",,Engenharia,Ambas,"INCT-EN (ALT20-03-0145-FEDER-023356) Instituto Nacional de Ciência e Tecnologia para Excitotoxicidade e Neuroproteção","Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia da Universidade Nova de Lisboa (Caparica, Portugal); Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal); Instituto Politécnico de Setúbal (Setubal, Portugal); Unidade de Tecnologia E Inovação (Oeiras, Portugal)",N/A,N/A,"João Mestre Dias; Patricia Lage; Nuno Alvarenga; João Garcia; Joana Borrega; Maria Teresa Santos; Célia Lampreia; Luis Coelho; João Pássaro; João Martins; José Caeiro; Elsa M.

The validation of the computer simulation and monitoring system was made with a batch of 40 ewe’s cheeses distributed in three different zones inside a prototype ripening room and ripened for 35 days. At 35 days, a physical, chemical, and microbiological characterization of cheeses was made for evaluation of the influence of environmental conditions on cheese quality. The comparison between simulated and local measurements showed close agreement, especially concerning air velocity inside the stacks of cheese. The results of Pearson’s correlation analysis and PCA concluded that temperature affected the appearance of the rind, hardness, number and area occupied by holes. Humidity affected aw and mFeret.

The same occurs in the development and evaluation of neural models, which should mimic the real neural centers that are being modeled. Several neural metrics have been proposed to analyze neural responses, and to tune and evaluate neural models. Neural metrics measure different characteristics of the neural code and can be grouped into distinct classes, as they follow a firing rate or time-code perspective. In this paper, several metrics belonging to the firing rate, spike train and firing event classes are reviewed. Using sets of neuronal responses and a set of models, the metrics are analyzed and compared to disclose their advantages and drawbacks. In most cases these metrics depend on a free parameter, that establishes their sensitivity to particular characteristics of the neural code. After showing that the incorrect choice of these parameters can lead to meaningless results, methods are presented in this paper to define a valid range of values for the parameters. These methods are based on a statistical analysis of the inter-trials errors. The application of neural metrics to the tuning and assessment of neural models of distinct classes reveals important results. Some of the analyzed metrics possess pronounced minima, specifically around the origin, which makes the optimization process more difficult; nonetheless, they provide insightful results for the evaluation of models. This paper also discusses the application of the neural metrics to evaluate neural models, providing relevant guidelines for their utilization. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

However, no single drought index can capture all dimensions of drought, necessitating a composite drought index (CDI) that integrates a range of indicators. This study proposes a CDI using principal component analysis (PCA) and a temporal dependence assessment (TDA) applied to time series of drought indices in a spatially distributed approach at the basin level. The indices considered include the Simplified Standardized Precipitation Index (SSPI), Simplified Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SSPEI), soil moisture (SM), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and streamflow (SF) from two climatically distinct small-sized basins in Portugal. Lag correlation analyses revealed a high contemporaneous correlation between SSPI and SSPEI (r > 0.8) and weaker but significant lagged correlations with SF (r > 0.5) and SM (r > 0.4). NDVI showed lagged and negligible correlations with the other indices. PCA was iteratively applied to the lag correlation-removed matrix of drought indices for all grid points, repeating the procedure for several SSPI/SSPEI time scales. The first principal component (PC1), capturing the majority of the matrix’s variability, was extracted and represented as the CDI for each grid point. Alternatively, the CDI was computed by combining the first and second PCs, using their variances as contribution weights. As PC1 shows its highest loadings on SSPI and SSPEI, with median loading values above 0.52 in all grid points, the proposed CDI demonstrated the highest agreement with SSPI and SSPEI across all grid cells, followed by SM, SF, and NDVI. Comparing the CDI’s performance with an independent indicator such as PDSI, which is not involved in the CDI’s construction, validated the CDI’s ability to comprehensively monitor drought in the studied basins with different hydroclimatological characteristics. Further validation is suggested by including other drought indicators/variables such as crop yield, soil moisture from different layers, and/or groundwater levels.","agricultural and hydrological drought ; composite drought index ; lag and cross correlation ; Palmer drought severity index ; principal component analysis",0,"Artigos em revista",17,Engenharia,Ambas,N/A,"Agricultural Research, Education &amp; Extension Organization, Iran (Tehran, Iran); Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal); Instituto Politécnico de Setúbal (Setubal, Portugal)",N/A,N/A,"João F.

An extensive analysis of drought phenomenon is presented for continental Croatia based on a meteorological E-OBS gridded dataset (0.25° × 0.25°), within the period of 1950–2022. The drought events were characterized by the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), applied to different time-scales (6 and 12 months), in order to describe the subannual and annual variability of drought. The spatiotemporal patterns of drought are obtained through principal component analysis (PCA) and K-means clustering (KMC) applied to the SPEI field. An areal drought evolution analysis and the changes in the frequency of occurrence of the periods under drought conditions were achieved using a kernel occurrence rate estimator (KORE). The modified Mann–Kendall (MMK) test, coupled with the Sen’s slope estimator test, are applied to the SPEI series in order to quantify the drought trends throughout the country. According to the history drought events and considering the different morphoclimatic characteristics of the study area, the results showed that Croatia could be divided into three different and spatially well-defined regions with specific temporal and spatial characteristics of droughts (central northern, eastern and southern regions). A manifest increase is shown in the percentage of area affected by drought, as well as in the yearly drought occurrences rates, in both central northern and eastern regions, and an evident decrease is shown in the southern region for both 6- and 12-month SPEI time-scales. In the observation of the drought’s temporal characteristics, it was found that downward trends expressing increasing drought severities were strongly significant in northern and eastern regions, while a few significant upward trends were seen in the southern region. From this study, it is possible to obtain a broader view of the historical behaviour of droughts in Croatia, with the results providing useful support for drought risk assessment and decision-making processes.","climate indices ; drought regionalization ; gridded dataset ; kernel occurrence rate estimator ; standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) ; trend analysis",5,"Artigos em revista",3806,Engenharia,Ambas,"H2020 (101003534) Horizon 2020 Framework Programme","CERIS – Civil Engineering Research and Innovation for Sustainability (Lisbon, Portugal); Associação do Instituto Superior Técnico para a Investigação e Desenvolvimento (Lisbon, Portugal); Sveučilište Josipa Jurja Strossmayera u Osijeku (Osijek, Croatia); Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal)",N/A,N/A,"João F.

The stability of the identified sub-regions as a function of studied time period was also evaluated applying the same methodologies to a set of three different time windows and it was found that the southern sub-region is very stable but the northern and central-eastern sub-regions are very sensitive to the selected time window.","Gridded dataset ; Principal component analysis ; Regional drought patterns ; SPI ; Trend analysis",29,"Artigos em revista",,Engenharia,Ambas,N/A,"Linking Landscape, Environment, Agriculture And Food (Lisbon, Portugal); Sapienza Università di Roma (Rome, Italy); Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal); Soil Conservation and Watershed Management Research Institute, Tehran (Tehran, Iran); Instituto Superior Técnico (Lisbon, Portugal)",N/A,N/A,"Tayeb Raziei; Diogo S.

For this purpose, the linkage of the spring SPI time series with the winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the sea surface temperature (SST) was investigated by means of maps of the correlation coefficient for the period from October 1910 to September 2004. The results indicate that the winter NAO is a good predictor for the SPI6 of the spring (SPI6 finishing in April, May and June, SPI6April, SPI6May and SPI6June, respectively) for the northern, central and southern regions of Portugal. The winter SST1 (area of the Mediterranean Sea) must only be considered for the northern region, and the winter SST3 (area of the North Atlantic between Iberia and North America) only for the southern region. Spatial maps of predictive SPI6 for April, May and June were created and validated. The neural models explained more than 81% of the total variance for the SPI6April and SPI6May and more than 64% of the total variance for the SPI6June. Probability maps were also developed considering the values predicted by the neural methods for the spring months and all drought categories (moderate, severe and extreme). These maps indicating the probability of droughts can provide valuable support for the integrated planning and management of water resources throughout Portugal. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Artificial neural networks ; Climatic indices ; Hindcasting ; NAO ; Standardized precipitation index",35,"Artigos em revista",,Engenharia,Ambas,N/A,"Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal); Universidad de Huelva (Huelva, Spain); Instituto Superior Técnico (Lisbon, Portugal)",N/A,N/A,"João Filipe Santos; Maria Manuela Portela; Inmaculada Pulido-Calvo","N/A; 0000-0002-4671-9884",N/A,N/A,N/A,"HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES",3,1009,1024,16

The majority of such changes happened in periods of hundreds, thousands or even millions of years as a result of natural causes, like small variations in Earth's orbit that change the amount of solar energy received by the planet. However, in recent decades, it has been progressively accepted by the scientific community that the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere is the major driving force of the climate change that presumably is occurring since the last century and mainly since the last 50-75 years. However, if there was a change in such a recent and short period, then the time series of the hydrologic variables more directly related to the climate, as the rainfall or the temperature, should denote signs of it, in the form of trends or non-homogeneities. In the previous scope, several studies have been conducted for mainland Portugal aiming at identifying trends in long hydrological time series and at trying to understand those trends from a climate change perspective. Some of the models applied for that purpose, as well as some of the results thus achieved, are briefly summarized. In general terms, the studies showed that the analyzed time series do not show the trends that are generally pointed out as denoting signs of the climate change, possibly due to their pronounced natural variability and to the insufficient length of the recording periods. There was only one exception, the rainfall in March which, in relative terms, denotes a significant decrease over mainland Portugal, such a decrease being however very small when considered in absolute terms.","climate change ; Gumbel law ; hydrologic time series ; kernel technique ; Mann-Kendall test ; moving average ; statistical models ; trend detection",2,"Artigos em revista",,Engenharia,Scopus,N/A,"Instituto Superior Técnico (Lisbon, Portugal); ESTIG (Beja, Portugal)",N/A,N/A,"M.

Depending on the characteristics of each natural process, certain stations may be spurious or redundant, whereas others may provide most of the relevant data. With the objective of reducing the costs of the monitoring system and, at the same time, improving its operational effectiveness, three procedures were applied to identify the minimum network of rain gauge stations able to capture the characteristics of droughts in mainland Portugal. Drought severity is characterized by the standardized precipitation index applied to the timescales of 1, 3, 6 and 12 consecutive months. The three techniques used to reduce the dimensionality of the network of rain gauges were as follows: (i) artificial neural networks with sensitivity analysis, (ii) application of the mutual information criterion and (iii) K-means cluster analysis using Euclidean distances. The results demonstrated that the best dimensionality reduction method was case dependent in the three regions of Portugal (northern, central and southern) previously identified by cluster analysis. All the reduction techniques lead to the selection of a subset of rain gauges capable of reproducing the original temporal patterns of drought.

Among such indices, one of the most common indices, if not the most widely used, is the standardized precipitation index (SPI), which assigns a numerical value to the monthly precipitation or to the cumulative precipitation in groups of consecutive months. Such a value can be compared across regions with very distinct climates. Despite the widespread use of the SPI, the interpretation of its values and drought monitoring based on the same are by no means trivial tasks, particularly due to the fact that are standardized values which cannot be easily related with the precipitation records from which they derived. For this very reason, an additional calculation method has been developed which returns back to the precipitation field the SPI values for any drought threshold. By assigning the drought thresholds directly to precipitation the meaning of the SPI results are clearer and the identification and monitoring of the drought occurrences are more expedite.

These three regions are consistent with the precipitation spatial distribution in Portugal Mainland, which in general terms decrease from North to South, with the central mountainous region representing the transition between the wet north and the progressively dry south.

The observation of the drought periods supports the occurrence of more frequent cycles of dry events in the south (droughts from moderate to extreme approximately every 3.6 years) than in the north (droughts from severe to extreme approximately every 13.4 years).

Pearson’s correlation analysis indicated that milk samples with higher protein content exhibited longer coagulation times but resulted in firmer curds. On the other hand, the use of cardoon flower extract introduced greater variability compared to chymosin, with a delayed onset of coagulation, reduced curd firmness, and increased variability in enzymatic kinetics.

This study aimed to investigate the effect of roasting time (30/55/80/105 min at 200 °C) on the physical–chemical properties of baobab seeds and the bioactive compounds in a coffee-like beverage. The results showed a decrease in moisture, Aw (water activity), and hardness of baobab seeds with increasing roasting time. These changes resulted from moisture loss, caramelization, and Maillard reactions, which also affected appearance when compared with unroasted baobab seeds. The pH of the beverage decreased to a value of around 6.01 after 105 min of roasting. The total phenolic content and antioxidant activity of the beverage increased with roasting time, reaching 851.2 mg GAE/100 g (after 80 min) and 18.9 mmol Fe2+/100 g (after 55 min), respectively.

Although natural Serpa’s rich microbiota allows for the development of a unique organoleptic profile, it also suggests high heterogeneity. This raises issues in the final sensory and safety properties, leading to several losses in the sector. A possible solution to overcoming these issues is the development of an autochthonous starter culture. In the present work, some Serpa cheese Lactic acid bacteria (LAB)-isolated microorganisms, previously selected based on their safety, technological and protective performance, were tested in laboratory-scale cheeses. Their acidification, proteolysis (protein and peptide profile, nitrogen fractions, free amino acids (FAA)), and volatiles generation (volatile fatty acids (VFA) and esters) potential was investigated. Significant differences were found in all parameters analyzed, showing a considerable strain effect. Successive statistical analyses were performed to compare cheese models and Serpa PDO cheese. The strains L. plantarum PL1 and PL2 and the PL1 and L. paracasei PC mix were selected as the most promising, resulting in a closer lipolytic and proteolytic profile of Serpa PDO cheese.

Multivariate statistics highlighted the variability of flower properties for cheesemaking, but allowed the aggregation of the ecotypes into five groups under the major influence of milk clotting activity and effect on gel firmness and micellar aggregation rate, followed by proteolytic activity.

Four different types of pellets were used and, for each one, the boiler was tested as a function of its capacity and the fan regulation affecting excess air. Measurements were performed for boiler heat load, pellets consumption rate, flue-gas temperature and composition. Mass balances allowed the calculation of the flue-gas flow rate and associated heat losses. Losses from incomplete combustion have also been quantified. Under boiler steady-state conditions the flue-gas O 2 concentration changes with boiler load and ventilation due to the regulation scheme of the boiler. Flue-gas CO shows a minimum for values of O 2 in the flue-gases of about 13%. NO x emissions are independent of excess air for low values of nitrogen in the fuel whereas, for larger values, NO x emissions increase with the O 2 present in the combustion products. The fractional conversion of the pellets nitrogen into NO x is in line with literature data. The boiler start-up was characterised by the temperature evolution inside and above the bed showing the propagation of combustion in the bed during about 10 min. During boiler start-up, a maximum in CO emissions was observed which is associated with the maximum combustion intensity, as typified by the flue-gas O 2 concentration and temperature, regardless the pellets type. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

First, the resistance was confirmed in field screening assays. Eight populations that survived nicosulfuron treatment at a field rate of 40 g ai ha−1 were labeled as putative-resistant. Dose–response trials demonstrated a high resistance in the eight populations (GR50 from 140.33 to 245.46 g ai ha−1). The synergism of malathion plus nicosulfuron demonstrated that the non-target-site resistance (NTSR) mechanism based on cytochrome P450 (Cyt-P450) was involved in five populations of I. unisetus. Molecular studies revealed that a single-nucleotide change occurs in the amino acid at position 376 (from GAT to GAG), which codifies from Asp-376 to Glu-376. This is the first time that Asp-376-Glu has been reported in this species. Assays in vitro and in vivo demonstrated I. unisetus cross-resistance to flucarbazone, penoxsulam, bispyribac-Na, and imazamox. No multiple resistance was found in two resistant populations exposed to different herbicides. Our results indicate that the lack of good control over Mexican grass in corn with ALS inhibitors is due to target-site mutation and NTSR mechanisms (Cyt-P450-mediated metabolism). A strategy should be established in Mexican fields to continue controlling this weed, including mechanical control practices and a good combination of the available pre- and post-emergence herbicides.","ALS activity ; Asp376Glu ; corn weeds ; cross-resistance ; non-target-site mechanism ; target-site mechanism",2,"Artigos em revista",1682,Biociências,Ambas,"(AGR-164) Asociación de Agroquímicos y Medioambiente","Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal); Universidad Autónoma Chapingo (Texcoco, Mexico); Universidad de Córdoba (Cordoba, Spain); Politécnico de Portalegre (Portalegre, Portugal); FMC Agrochemical of Mexico (Zapopan, Mexico)",N/A,N/A,"José Alfredo Domínguez-Valenzuela; José G.

Despite the diversity of weed communities, it is of interest how selection has led to the same consequences in distant regions. Brassica rapa is a widespread naturalized weed that is found throughout temperate North and South America, and it is a frequent weed among winter cereal crops in Argentina and in Mexico. Broadleaf weed control is based on glyphosate that is used prior to sowing and sulfonylureas or mimic auxin herbicides that are used once the weeds have already emerged. This study was aimed at determining whether a convergent phenotypic adaptation to multiple herbicides had occurred in B. rapa populations from Mexico and Argentina by comparing the herbicide sensitivity to inhibitors of the acetolactate synthase (ALS), 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate (EPSPS), and auxin mimics. Five B. rapa populations were analyzed from seeds collected in wheat fields in Argentina (Ar1 and Ar2) and barley fields in Mexico (Mx1, Mx2 and MxS). Mx1, Mx2, and Ar1 populations presented multiple resistance to ALS- and EPSPS-inhibitors and to auxin mimics (2,4-D, MCPA, and fluroxypyr), while the Ar2 population showed resistance only to ALS-inhibitors and glyphosate. Resistance factors ranged from 947 to 4069 for tribenuron-methyl, from 1.5 to 9.4 for 2,4-D, and from 2.7 to 42 for glyphosate. These were consistent with ALS activity, ethylene production, and shikimate accumulation analyses in response to tribenuron-methyl, 2,4-D, and glyphosate, respectively. These results fully support the evolution of the multiple- and cross-herbicide resistance to glyphosate, ALS-inhibitors, and auxinic herbicides in B. rapa populations from Mexico and Argentina.","ALS enzyme activity ; ethylene production ; herbicide tolerant crops ; oilseed rape ; resistant gene flow ; shikimic acid accumulation",2,"Artigos em revista",2119,Biociências,Ambas,"CNPq (105187/2023-2) Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico","Universidad Nacional de La Pampa (Santa Rosa, Argentina); Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal); Universidade Federal de São Carlos (Sao Carlos, Brazil); Universidad Autónoma Chapingo (Texcoco, Mexico); Universidad de Córdoba (Cordoba, Spain); Politécnico de Portalegre (Portalegre, Portugal); Private Consultant in Weed Control (Buenos Aires, Argentina)",N/A,N/A,"José Alfredo Dominguez-Valenzuela; Candelario Palma-Bautista; José G.

Species of the genus Filago, in addition to invading Spanish olive groves, have developed certain levels of natural tolerance to the acetolactate synthase (ALS) inhibiting herbicide flazasulfuron. The objective of this study was to determine the level and the mechanism involved in the tolerance to flazasulfuron in Filago pyramidata L., which occurs in olive groves of southern Spain, as well as to identify possible cross- or multiple-tolerances by evaluating alternative herbicides for its control. A population resistant (R) to flazasulfuron and a susceptible (S) one of Conyza canadensis were used as references. The accessions of F. pyramidata presented LD50 values (from 72 to 81 g active ingredient (ai) ha−1) higher than the field dose of flazasulfuron (50 g ai ha−1), being 11–12.5 times more tolerant than the S population of C. canadensis, but less than half the R population (170 g ai ha−1). Enzymatically, F. pyramidata was as sensitive to flazasulfuron (I50 = 17.3 μM) as the S population of C. canadensis. Filago pyramidata plants treated with flazasulfuron, combined with 4-chloro-7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazole, had a growth reduction of up to 85%, revealing the participation of glutathione-S-transferases in herbicide metabolism. Filago pyramidata presented cross-tolerance to the different chemical groups of ALS inhibitors, except triazolinones (florasulam). Synthetic auxins (2,4-D and fluroxypyr) presented good control, but some individuals survived (low multiple resistance). Cellulose synthesis, 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate, 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase, protoporphyrinogen oxidase, photosystem I, and photosystem II inhibitor herbicides, applied in PRE or POST-emergence, presented excellent levels of control of F. pyramidata. These results confirmed the natural tolerance of F. pyramidata to flazasulfuron and cross-tolerance to most ALS-inhibiting herbicides. The mechanism involved was enhanced metabolism mediated by glutathione-S-transferases, which also conferred low multiple tolerance to synthetic auxins.

In 2020, C. acanthoides was found with multiple resistance to these two herbicides. In this study, the mechanisms that confer multiple resistance to glyphosate and 2,4-D, were characterized in one resistant (R) population of C. acanthoides in comparison to a susceptible (S) population. No differences in 14C-herbicide absorption and translocation were observed between R and S populations. In addition, 14C-glyphosate was well translocated to the shoots (∼30%) and roots (∼16%) in both R and S plants, while most of 14C-2,4-D remained restricted in the treated leaf. Glyphosate metabolism did not contribute to resistance of the R population; however, as corroborated by malathion pretreatment, the mechanism of resistance to 2,4-D was enhanced metabolism (63% of the herbicide) mediated by cytochrome P450 (Cyt-P450). No differences were found in baseline EPSPS activity, copy number, and/or gene expression between the R and S populations, but a Pro-106-Ser mutation in EPSPS was present in the R population. Multiple resistances in the R population of C. acanthoides from Argentina were governed by target site resistance (a Pro-106 mutation for glyphosate) and non-target site resistance (Cyt-P450-based metabolic resistance for 2,4-D) mechanisms.

Weedy species from genus Avena have been observed after the application of glyphosate in wheat. Here, Avena fatua (two accessions), Avena byzantina and Avena sterilis subsp. sterilis, one accession each, were taxonomically characterized by a biometric study. Dose-response trials confirmed that one A. fatua accession evolved to resistance, because it was four times more resistant (R) than the others, ascribed as susceptible (S). In addition, based on LD50, A. byzantina and A. sterilis had low susceptibility to glyphosate, with 604 and 458 g ae ha−1. Shikimic acid accumulation was able to discriminate between high susceptible (A. fatua (S)), low susceptible (A. byzantina and A. sterilis), and low resistant (A. fatua (R)) populations. On the other hand, the study revealed that A. fatua (R), A. byzantina and A. sterilis had low foliar uptake and decreased movement of glyphosate. In addition, the metabolism study showed less metabolite accumulation in A. byzantina and A. fatua (S). However, at 96 h after glyphosate application, A. fatua (R) and A. sterilis were able to convert more than 30% of glyphosate to aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) and sarcosine. Enzyme basal activity and I50 values predicted high affinity between the herbicide and the target enzyme for all accessions, thus indicating that a target-site (TS) mechanism is probably not involved in the differences in glyphosate susceptibility.

In 2008, a tribenuron-methyl (TM) resistant (R) S. alba population was first reported in a cereal field in Malaga (southern Spain). In 2018, three suspected R S. alba populations (R1, R2 and R3) to TM were collected from three different fields in Granada (southern Spain, 100 km away from Malaga). The present work aims to confirm the putative resistance of these populations to TM and explore their resistance mechanisms. Dose–response assays showed that the R1, R2 and R3 populations ranging between 57.4, 44.4 and 57.1 times more resistance to TM than the susceptible population (S). A mutation in the ALS gene (Asp376Glu) was detected in the Rs S. alba populations. 14C-metabolism studies show that metabolites and TM were changing significantly faster in the R than in the S plants. Alternative chemical control trials showed that 2,4-D and MCPA (auxin mimics), glyphosate (enolpyruvyl shikimate phosphate synthase,EPSPS, inhibitor-group 9), metribuzin (PSII inhibitors/Serine 264 Binders, -group 5) and mesotrione (hydroxyphenyl pyruvate dioxygenase, HPPD, inhibitor-group 27) presented a high control of the four populations of S. alba tested, both S and R. Based on these results, it is the first case described where the Asp376Glu mutation and P450-mediated metabolism participates in resistance to TM in S. alba. Comparing these results with those found in the S. alba population in Malaga in 2008, where the resistance was TSR type (Pro197Ser), we can suggest that despite the geographical proximity (over 100 km), the resistance in these cases was due to different evolutionary events.","acetolactate synthase ; auxin mimics ; chemical control ; cross-resistance ; wheat-weed",6,"Artigos em revista",1011596,Biociências,Ambas,"MCIU (RYC2018-023866-I) Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades","Universitat de Lleida (Lleida, Spain); Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal); Universidad de Córdoba (Cordoba, Spain); Extremadura Scientific and Technological Research Center (CICYTEX) (Guadajira, Spain)",N/A,N/A,"Candelario Palma-Bautista; José G.

This crop production system includes other tolerant cultivars to the application of imidazolinone (IMI) herbicides. However, the continuous use and off-label rates of IMI herbicides can contribute to the development of resistance in Lolium rigidum and other weed species. In this research, the main objectives were to study the resistance mechanisms to acetolactate synthase (ALS) and acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase (ACCase) inhibitors in a L. rigidum accession (LrR) from a Clearfield® wheat field, with a long history rotating these IMI-tolerant crops and compare them with those present in the IMI-tolerant wheat. The resistance to ACCase inhibitors in LrR was due to point mutations (Ile1781Leu plus Asp2078Gly) of the target site gene plus an enhanced herbicide metabolism (EHM), on the other hand, in wheat accessions was due only by EHM. Mechanisms involved in the resistance to ALS inhibitors were both point mutations of the target gene and EHM in the IMI-tolerant wheat, while only evidence of mutation (Trp574Leu) was found in the multiple herbicide resistant L. rigidum accession. This research demonstrates that if crop rotation is not accompanied by the use of alternative sites of action in herbicide-tolerant crops, resistant weeds to herbicide to which crops are tolerant, can easily be selected. Moreover, repeated and inappropriate use of Clearfield® crops and herbicide rotations can lead to the evolution of multiple resistant weeds, as shown in this study, and have also inestimable environmental impacts.","Crop tolerance ; Enhanced metabolism ; Non-target site mechanisms ; Point mutations ; Weed resistance",4,"Artigos em revista",119438,Biociências,Ambas,"MCIU (RYC2018-023866-I) Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades","Universitat de Lleida (Lleida, Spain); Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal); Universidad de Córdoba (Cordoba, Spain); Politécnico de Portalegre (Portalegre, Portugal); FMC Agroquímica de México (Zapopan, Mexico); Extremadura Scientific and Technological Research Center (CICYTEX) (Guadajira, Spain)",N/A,N/A,"José G.

Stacked traits conferring this dual herbicide resistance in these lines, compared with a susceptible (S) cultivar, were characterized. RESULTS: Rados and Helter lines were ∼ 18-fold more resistant (R) to glufosinate, and between 15.1 and 19.8-fold more resistant to imazamox than the S cultivar. Resistance to glufosinate and imazamox decreased up to 12% and 50%, respectively, when the herbicides were applied sequentially. The basal activities of the acetolactate and glutamine synthases were similar between R and S plants. Rados and Helter lines were 11.7- and 17.7-fold more resistant to imazamox than the S cultivar, due to the Ser653–Asn mutation in their imi-ALS genes. R lines, susceptible to glufosinate at the target site level, showed lower ammonia accumulation evidencing the activity of the phosphinothricin acetyl transferase. Absorption and translocation patterns for 14 C-imazamox and 14 C-glufosinate were similar between R and S cultivars and so do not contribute to resistance. CONCLUSION: Stacked traits conferring dual herbicide resistance to the lines Rados and Helter come from the resistant parents.

The factors evaluated consisted of weed density (from 0 up to 6 plants m-2) and time of weed interference (early bloom stage, full flowering stage, fruit filling, and harvest time). The effects of competition on tomato fruit quality were analysed using a multiple model. Tomato variables evaluated included industrial fruit types (which depended on ripeness and disease infection) and soluble solids level (obrix). Tomato fruit quality is dependent on the factors tested. Under low densities (< 6 plants m-2) of S. americanum there was a small impact on the quality of the tomato fruits. The percentage of grade A (mature fruit with red color and without pathogen infection) tomato fruits is the variable most affect by the independent variables. The impact of these independent variables on the percentage of grade C (green and/or with more than 15% disease infection) tomato yield was of smaller magnitude and in an inverse trend as the observed for grade A. The level of soluble solids was influenced by the weed interference on only two experiments, but the impact was of small magnitude.

The impacts identified by the literature were compared with the perceptions held by computer science students of two different HE institutions (HEIs) on the topic. An exploratory study was developed based on the application of a questionnaire to a group of 112 students. The results suggest that while Gen AI can enhance academic work and learning feedback, it requires appropriate pedagogical support to foster critical, ethical, and digital literacy competencies.

In this paper, the characterization of several types of events is proposed, associated with different types of signals, such as Boolean and multivalued signals. The major goal of this characterization is to improve the compactness of the model, benefiting the editing and visual interpretation of the graphical model but keeping precise execution semantics, which in turn allows for the use of computational tools covering the different stages of system development. The behavioral model of the controller is produced using a non-autonomous class of Petri nets, the IOPT nets, and the associated IOPT-Tools, which supports the specification, simulation, property verification, and automatic code generation ready to be deployed into implementation platforms. All the types of proposed events have a behavioral sub-model executed concurrently with the main model of the controller.

Roguelike games, a genre defined by procedurally generated environments and random map creation, are used to validate the proposal. Navigation is constrained by resource availability and specific conditions that allow or block movement between adjacent areas. Players can collect specific resources in visited areas, which can be used to allow/unlock passages. The main goals include determining whether, given a specific randomly generated map/graph, along with all associated constraints and resources, the game is inviable (when it is not possible to reach the final area of the game), nonviable (when depending on the player’s options, it is possible or not to reach the final goal), or viable (when the ultimate goal area can always be reached regardless of user’s choices over time).

Debugging capabilities include execution pausing, step-by-step execution and continuous execution, and the definition of break-points associated with transition firing. Users may remotely force values on input signals and inspect the values of output signals to test conditions that would otherwise require physical interaction with the hardware systems. The tool records the evolution of all signals and state variables.

Several types of events can be defined, considering different types of signals, including Boolean and multi-valued signals, as well as different types of dependencies in terms of the evolution of the signals. For the presented work, the model of the controller is produced using IOPT nets, a non-autonomous Petri nets class. In this paper, a set of translation rules for several types of events is proposed allowing the generation of behaviorally equivalent IOPT Petri net models, which will be executed concurrently with the main model constrained by the translated events.

This brings an additional complication for novice students, which are also fighting with flow control and composition. Graphical languages can help visualise the program structure but only if they are not seen as an additional burden. UML class diagrams are the most widely used structure diagram for object-oriented code, but they are very complex for novices. This paper presents a set of translation rules from code to a UML class diagrams that can be introduced in the first or second programming course. To that end, it discusses how to meaningfully explain the semantics of class and object relations, namely by presenting a minimal subset of the UML class diagram metamodel that supports simple and direct translations from object-oriented code. As most students learn better from concrete to abstract, this minimal subset and the respective code translation provide an intermediate step towards the use of a more complete metamodel in more advanced courses.

Starting from Coloured Petri nets, the paper shows how those abstractions can be modelled based on node fusion and with minimally intrusive syntax additions.

However, regarding these therapeutic options as feasible in all situations can be harmful, since it is universally accepted that, despite all advances in health, there are inevitable limits and the promotion of some interventions may be useless or futile.

Results: There is no universally accepted definition for the concept of futility. In the literature there are different conceptions for the concept of futility that point to qualitative and quantitative roots and that are associated with ethical dilemmas that make it difficult to conceptualize this concept and make it operational in clinical practice. Conclusion: The central elements of the concept of futility include: the diagnosis of futility is closely related to clinical judgment; futility has both quantitative and qualitative roots; futility is always appreciated posteriori; futility is related to the lack of benefit.

Epidemiologic data is however unavailable. We aimed to provide an international picture of the extent of pressure injuries and factors associated with ICU-acquired pressure injuries in adult ICU patients. Methods: International 1-day point-prevalence study; follow-up for outcome assessment until hospital discharge (maximum 12 weeks). Factors associated with ICU-acquired pressure injury and hospital mortality were assessed by generalised linear mixed-effects regression analysis. Results: Data from 13,254 patients in 1117 ICUs (90 countries) revealed 6747 pressure injuries; 3997 (59.2%) were ICU-acquired. Overall prevalence was 26.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 25.9–27.3). ICU-acquired prevalence was 16.2% (95% CI 15.6–16.8). Sacrum (37%) and heels (19.5%) were most affected. Factors independently associated with ICU-acquired pressure injuries were older age, male sex, being underweight, emergency surgery, higher Simplified Acute Physiology Score II, Braden score < 19, ICU stay > 3 days, comorbidities (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, immunodeficiency), organ support (renal replacement, mechanical ventilation on ICU admission), and being in a low or lower-middle income-economy. Gradually increasing associations with mortality were identified for increasing severity of pressure injury: stage I (odds ratio [OR] 1.5; 95% CI 1.2–1.8), stage II (OR 1.6; 95% CI 1.4–1.9), and stage III or worse (OR 2.8; 95% CI 2.3–3.3). Conclusion: Pressure injuries are common in adult ICU patients. ICU-acquired pressure injuries are associated with mainly intrinsic factors and mortality. Optimal care standards, increased awareness, appropriate resource allocation, and further research into optimal prevention are pivotal to tackle this important patient safety threat.","Decubitus epidemiology ; ICU ; Morbidity ; Mortality ; Outcome ; Pressure injury ; Pressure ulcer ; Risk factors",168,"Artigos em revista",,,Ambas,"SRI  Sunnybrook Research Institute","Sunnybrook Research Institute (Toronto, Canada); Griffith Health (Brisbane, Australia); Menzies Health Institute Queensland (Southport, Australia); Al Mafraq Hospital (Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates); University of Niš (Nis, Serbia); Universitat Internacional de Catalunya (Barcelona, Spain); Universitair Ziekenhuis Gent (Ghent, Belgium); Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Brugmann, Brussels (Brussels, Belgium); University of the Sunshine Coast (Sippy Downs, Australia); University of Huddersfield (Huddersfield, United Kingdom); Wake Forest University School of Medicine (Winston Salem, United States); University of Michigan, Ann Arbor (Ann Arbor, United States); University of Toronto Faculty of Medicine (Toronto, Canada); Universitätsmedizin Göttingen (Gottingen, Germany); Hogeschool Gent (Ghent, Belgium); Imperial College London (London, United Kingdom); School of Medicine, Dentistry and Biomedical Sciences (Belfast, United Kingdom); King's College London (London, United Kingdom); Queensland University of Technology (Brisbane, Australia); Toronto East Health Network (Toronto, Canada); NHS England (Wakefield, United Kingdom); Royal Devon and Exeter NHS Foundation Trust (Exeter, United Kingdom); Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Grenoble (Grenoble, France); Universiteit Ghent, Faculteit Geneeskunde en Gezondheidswetenschappen (Ghent, Belgium); Hadassah University Medical Centre (Jerusalem, Israel); Outcomes Research Consortium (Cleveland, United States); European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (Brussels, Belgium)",N/A,N/A,"Sonia O.

Intensive care units are systems organized for the provision of care to patients in critical situations. In general, it is suggested that intensive care consists of a multidisciplinary and interprofessional specialty. Nevertheless, the predominance, relative to the professions that incorporate these units, falls on nurses. A conceptual model of nursing provides a framework for reflection, observation, and interpretation of phenomena and, specifically, it provides guidelines and guidance for aspects of clinical practice. Objective. To understand the applicability of conceptual models of nursing in intensive care units. Method. Review of the literature following the Scoping Review protocol of the Joanna Briggs Institute. The research was performed in CINAHL, Cochrane, Pubmed, Scopus, and Web of Science to identify studies published prior to 2021. Fourteen studies were selected. Results. There is no conceptual model of nursing universally accepted as ideal for intensive care units. However, there is unanimity in the identification of several benefits associated with the application of a conceptual model of nursing in the care of critically ill patients. Conclusion. For the selection of a conceptual model of nursing for these contexts, the focus should be on the person and the choice should fall on the model that is most appropriate to the patient, and not on the philosophy that supports the model. Considering the nature of care, the nursing team can select a model or a combination of models.",,1,"Artigos em revista",5583319,N/A,Scopus,"FCT (UIDB/04279/2020) Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia","University of Évora (Evora, Portugal); Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal); Universidade Católica Portuguesa (Lisbon, Portugal)",N/A,N/A,"João V.

Changes in swallowing, one of the most common sequelae of this neurological event, have a negative impact on the person’s prognosis, contributing to high morbidity and mortality rates, due to the risk of dehydration, malnutrition and aspiration pneumonia. Nurses, the health professionals who participate more actively in feeding and patient supervision, may play a key role in the early detection of swallowing changes in this population. Objective: To identify the benefits of nursing interventions in the prevention of complications in the elderly with changes in swallowing after stroke. Method: Systematic review that led to the search in the EBSCOHost search engine, in the databases CINAHL Complete and MEDLINE Complete, to identify studies published between 2015 and 2019, using the descriptors “stroke”, “intervention”, “nurse” “ and “deglutition disorders “. After implementing the inclusion and exclusion criteria and evaluating the methodological quality of the results obtained, three studies were selected. The levels of evidence were assured by the levels of evidence proposed by Melnyk and Fineout-Overholt. Results: Nursing interventions for the elderly with changes in swallowing after stroke can contribute to improvements in the prevention of complications, well-being and self-care, health promotion and continuity of care. Conclusion: The benefits of nursing interventions to the elderly with changes in swallowing after stroke are evident.

In an ever-changing economy where continuous innovation (much of it originating from engineering) is a prerequisite for a country's competitiveness and business growth, a purely technical education for engineers appears insufficient to provide organizations with a comprehensive contribution. The growing recognition of this contribution has led higher education institutions (HEIs) offering engineering study programs, which did not previously include entrepreneurship modules in their curricula, to introduce curricular units (CU) to fill this gap and encourage their students to explore the commercial potential of their research/technologies. This study reflects on various aspects related to the introduction of CU about entrepreneurship in the curricula of engineering courses through a literature review supplemented by observations resulting from participation in processes leading to the incorporation of CU entrepreneurship in engineering courses. We identified several factors that can contribute to the success of entrepreneurship in these study programs: (i) the emphasis on innovation and entrepreneurship policies in society; (ii) the involvement of the institution and its leaders in the curricula change; (iii) the presence of teaching staff with a profile suitable for teaching entrepreneurship; (iv) students' favorable attitude towards entrepreneurship. Additionally, our reflection suggests that defining the objectives of the curricular unit should consider the specificities of engineering courses. Furthermore, the selection of content should take into account the students' need to develop the essential skills required for creating a business. The study concludes that adopting a more practical approach oriented towards creating new enterprises, involving entrepreneurs in teaching, and providing facilitating conditions for the development of business ideas within the institution are essential. By identifying various factors that can contribute to the success of introducing entrepreneurship subjects in engineering courses, the paper offers valuable insights for educational institutions to understand and address potential obstacles during the implementation process.

We examine this question in Portugal which experienced one of the deepest recessions in the European Union following the implementation of severe austerity measures. This study confirms that government intervention to support angel investing can have a positive impact. However, the different types of intervention have varied in take-up rates.

Hip-directed steering(HDS) is a novel physical technique for controlling direction changes in virtual travel using hip movements. We present an WIP-based navigation approach for controlling locomotion in VEs that combines the speed and direction in a scenario similar to a domestic setup in which people interact with a flat screen. Their physical motion data are captured by one depth camera properly aligned with the screen and oriented toward the user. We approach the characteristically noisy data generated by depth cameras via a user study to determine both the range of values and their robustness from the motion data associated with the joints relevant to WIP speed(knee, ankle and foot) and HDS (spine, hip and shoulder) to derive a reliable technique. Our WIP speed method is supported in a simple vocabulary of five different footstep types. Experimental results show that both the knee and hip provide the most robust data. We evaluated our techniques via usability tests exercising common locomotion tasks. The results show that users liked both the speed control and comfort afforded by our speed method. Regarding HDS, users reported that the angular-based method allowed them to travel faster and was both more controllable and easier to learn than the time-based method.

We argue that our approach allows users to better control the virtual distance covered by the footsteps, achieve higher average speeds and experience less fatigue than when using state-of-the-art methods based on footstep frequency, called GUD-WIP. An in-depth user evaluation with twenty participants compared our approach to GUD-WIP on common travel tasks over a range of short, medium and long distances. We measured task performance using four distinct criteria: effectiveness, precision, efficiency and speed. The results show that SAS-WIP is both more efficient and faster than GUD-WIP when walking long distances while being more effective and precise over short distances. When asked their opinion via a post-test questionnaire, participants preferred SAS-WIP to GUD-WIP and reported experiencing less fatigue, having more fun and having a greater level of control when using our approach. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.","motor control ; performance ; virtual locomotion ; virtual speed control ; Walking in place",25,"Artigos em conferência",,Engenharia,Scopus,N/A,"Instituto de Engenharia de Sistemas e Computadores: Investigação e Desenvolvimento em Lisboa (Lisbon, Portugal)",N/A,N/A,"Luís Bruno; João Pereira; Joaquim Jorge","N/A; 0000-0003-3313-7858",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

It was designed to offer natural interaction in visualization setups such as large-scale displays, head mounted displays or TabletPC computers. To support architectural design, our system provides content creation and manipulation, 3D scene navigation and annotations. Users can interact with the system using laser pointers, speech commands, body gestures and mobile devices. In this paper, we describe how we design a system to answer architectural user requirements. In particular, our system takes advantage of multiple modalities to provide a natural interaction for design review. We also propose a new graphical user interface adapted to architectural user tasks, such as navigation or annotations. The interface relies on a novel stroke-based interaction supported by simple laser pointers as input devices for large-scale displays. Furthermore, input devices such as speech and body tracking allow IMMIView to support multiple users. Moreover, they allow each user to select different modalities according to their preference and modality adequacy for the user task. We present a multi-modal fusion system developed to support multi-modal commands on a collaborative, co-located, environment, i.e. with two or more users interacting at the same time, on the same system. The multi-modal fusion system listens to inputs from all the IMMIView modules in order to model user actions and issue commands. The multiple modalities are fused based on a simple rule-based sub-module developed in IMMIView and presented in this paper. User evaluation performed over IMMIView is presented. The results show that users feel comfortable with the system and suggest that users prefer the multi-modal approach to more conventional interactions, such as mouse and menus, for the architectural tasks presented. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.","Design review ; Human-computer interaction ; Mixed reality ; Real-time collaborativeInteraction ; Virtual reality",9,"Artigos em revista",,Engenharia,Ambas,"FCT (SFRH/BD/ 17574/2004) Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia","Instituto Superior Técnico (Lisbon, Portugal)",N/A,N/A,"Ricardo Jota; Bruno R. de Araújo; Luís C.

SCOPUS_ID:85171302095,"Straw embroideries in Azores (Portugal)","de Carvalho L.M.","Ethnobotany Research and Applications",10.32859/era.26.33.1-7,,,26,,,,2023-06-18,"Wheat or rye straw embroideries, typical of the island of Faial (Azores), are the ultimate representatives of a European craft very popular in the XIX century. Our investigation into the cultural use of plants in the Azores presents some examples of straw embroideries and information on the raw materials of plant origin used by the last embroideresses who keep this tradition alive. Azores and the straw embroidery The Azores Archipelago, located on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, between Europe and North America, was uninhabited when the first Portuguese navigators arrived in 1427 and the arrival of Europeans had severe consequences for the natural ecosystems, that were replaced by agricultural lands, pastures, and, later, by woodlands of exotic trees. The Azores have a very rich flora, with 84 species and infra-species endemic taxa (acores.flora-on.pt), but few of the native and endemic plants are now used as raw materials because the material needs of the population rely almost entirely in introduced species. The traditional arts and crafts are also diverse, and it is in Azores that we find a unique European tradition – the straw embroidery. The European history of straw use for weaving is Millenia old, and we can find exquisite examples in many countries, such as in Belarus, which recently (2022) added this tradition to UNESCO List of Intangible Cultural Heritage (ich.unesco.org) but the pattern of straw work that we find in Azores is closer to the traditions recorded in France (Figure 1), Belgium, Italy, or Switzerland from the XVII century on, when straw was used to embroider in cotton, linen, or silk. An extraordinary sample of this ancient art is the Good Shepherd altar (Figure 2) made by French nuns from the Couvent des Annonciades [Convent of Annonciades], in Nozeroy, and now preserved at the local Collégiale Saint-Antoine [Collegiate Church of Saint-Antoine] (Fitch 1998). In the Azores, the straw embroideries are made in the island of Faial; one of the nine islands of the archipelago. The origin of this art in Azores is uncertain although tradition says it started in the middle of the XIX century, with a French embroidered hat sent from Boston to Faial, to inquire about the possibility of producing similar works in Azores. Local embroideresses studied the technique, perfected it and a new craft began (Andrade 2008). The fashion of using straw-embroidered fabrics was very much in vogue in the mid-nineteenth century, especially to adorn ball gowns (Figure 3) and accessories for festive use. The embroidery begins with the selection of the design, which depends on the piece of clothing the embroideress will create. The design is transferred to a thick paper which will be attached under the cotton or nylon tulle, the fabric to which the straw will be embroidered. The tulle is usually black but white tulle can also be used. The dried straw is obtained from locally grown wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) or rye (Secale cereale L.). To increase the golden shine of the straw, this may be dyed with safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.) – a species grown in Azores for its flowers’ edible dye. The straw is always prepared by the embroideress, who cuts it from top to bottom with a splitter, dividing each straw in five or six long segments. After this operation, the inner straw layers are removed with a knife or an awl-like object to obtain the strips that will be embroidered directly in the tulle netting, without needles but with the aid of a thimble. Most of the embroidery is made with isolated stitches that do not touch each other (Figure 4). Fibers obtained from leaves of the American aloe (Agave americana L.) are used to create the lines that unite sections of the embroidery and to add details in the design, which usually has the shape of cereal ears, grapes, flowers, and other plant motifs (Silva 2006, Andrade 2008, Teixeira 2016). In the past, this embroidery was common in shawls (Figure 5), scarves, hats, table mats (Figure 6), and ball dresses used locally or exported to continental Europe and USA. The former American First Lady, Jacqueline Kennedy (1929-1994), used Azorean straw embroideries to reinforce the historical links this country has with Azores, where the oldest (1790) continuously operating USA consulate in the world is located (pt.usembassy.gov). Currently it is mainly a product for tourists, rarely used by the Azoreans, although it has a high cultural value to the Faial community. This craft has always been a feminine cottage industry and it is now protected and certified by law [Regional Government Ordinance 89/1998, Dezember 3rd], intended to add value and prestige to the last embroideresses who still maintain this plant-based tradition alive.",,0,"Artigos em revista",33,Biociências,Scopus,N/A,"Universidade Nova de Lisboa (Lisbon, Portugal); University of Évora (Evora, Portugal); Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal)",N/A,N/A,"Luis Mendonça de Carvalho; Francisca Maria Fernandes; Paula Nozes; Sara Albuquerque; Maria de Fátima Nunes","N/A; 0000-0001-8536-5583",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Aim: To study and characterise the airborne pollen concentration in Beja for a period of two years. Material and methods: The atmosphere of Beja was studied aerobiologically from January 2003 to January 2005, using a Hirst volumetric sporetrap placed 13 m above ground level. Results: Sixty-two pollen types were identified, 22 of which were present for at least 50 days, in at least one of the years. The mean annual pollen concentration was 135 pollen grains/m3 for 2003 and 85 pollen grains /m3 for 2004. Most of the pollen (76%) was from four types - in decreasing order: Poaceae, Quercus spp., Olea europaea, and Cupressaceae. May was the month with the highest mean pollen concentration, with mean values of 1069 pollen grains /m3 in 2003 and 466 pollen grains /m3 in 2004, and a daily pollen peak of 2485 pollen grains /m3 for Poaceae in 2003, and 1198 pollen grains /m3 for Olea europaea in 2004. The ornamental flora of the city was recorded, and a total of 6633 ornamental trees belonging to 58 species were identified. Conclusions: This first aerobiological assessment of Beja allowed the draft of a preliminary pollen calendar. The differences between the two years were mainly due to the Poaceae pollen type, which had a threefold higher value in 2003, compared to 2004, probably due to the more intense April rains in 2003 that favoured the growth and pollen production of grasses and other herbaecea. In 2003, there was also a statistically significant correlation between the number of ornamental trees and their respective airborne pollen in the air of the city.","Aerobiology ; Airborne pollen ; Alentejo ; Beja ; Portugal ; Trees",4,"Artigos em revista",,Biociências,Scopus,N/A,"Universidad de Extremadura (Badajoz, Spain); Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal)",N/A,N/A,"Francisca Maria Fernandes; Rafael Tormo Molina; Luís Manuel Mendonça de Carvalho","N/A; 0000-0001-8536-5583",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Nevertheless, spectral occupancy studies have shown a low utilization rate of some licensed frequency bands both in time and geographic location. Cognitive Radio (CR) is a promising technology to address spectrum sharing by selectively detecting bands not being in use by a Primary User (PU) and opportunistically allocating them for a Secondary User (SU) utilization. However, the detection of unused frequency bands, which is the most challenging problem in CR, can be overcome by exploiting cyclostationary features exhibited in the received signal. Most, if not all, communications signals have cyclostationary signatures, which can be used to detect the PU. However, detecting these signatures requires a fine resolution in cycle frequency, which can cause high computational complexity when computing the discrete Spectral Correlation Function (SCF). This paper presents an innovative adaptation of the well-known FFT Accumulation Method (FAM) to efficiently obtain the SCF in a zoomed/local sub-band of the entire frequency and cycle frequency (f;α) plane. Computational complexity comparison of the FAM and the proposed zoom FAM (zFAM) algorithms is addressed, and computer simulation results are presented to illustrate the zFAM superiority to detect the cyclostationary features in a small region of the (f;α) plane.","Cognitive radio ; Cyclostationary detection ; FFT accumulation method (FAM) ; Spectral correlation function (SCF) ; Spectrum sensing",1,"Artigos em revista",103316,Engenharia,Ambas,"CTS (PCIF/SSI/0102/2017) Canadian Thoracic Society","Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia da Universidade Nova de Lisboa (Caparica, Portugal); Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal); Instituto de Engenharia de Sistemas e Computadores, Lisbon (Lisbon, Portugal); Instituto de Desenvolvimento de Novas Tecnologias (Caparica, Portugal); Instituto Superior Técnico (Lisbon, Portugal)",N/A,N/A,"Miguel Tavares; José Gerald; João Goes","0000-0002-2232-0422; 0000-0002-5230-2137; N/A",N/A,N/A,N/A,"DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING",,,,11

However, the increasingly large fluctuations between years in temperatures and precipitation due to climate change cause important variations in wheat production worldwide. This fact makes wheat breeding programs a tool that, far from going out of fashion, is becoming the most important solution to develop varieties that can provide humanity with the sufficient amount of food it demands without forgetting the objective of quality. Material and methods: The National Institute of Agricultural and Veterinary Research in Portugal has carried out a long-term experiment (9 years) in different locations to test four different bread-making wheat cultivars, each representing important variations in germplasm. Wheat yield and quality traits obtained by official methods were recorded in 18 different environments regarding temperature and precipitation. Results and discussion: According to the ANOVA and PCA, protein content, wet gluten, dough tenacity, and extensibility were found to be highly affected by the environment. Paiva cultivar presented a higher yield in almost all the tested environments, but its quality traits varied enormously. Contrary behavior was recorded for Valbona cultivar. Antequera cultivar, with a production ranging between 4.7 and 9.3 tons/ha and a protein content between 11 and 16.8%, seems to be the most resilient cultivar regarding both productivity and quality of the flour with reference to changes in the main climate traits. The most ancient cultivar, Roxo, released in 1996, showed the worst results in this experiment, supporting the need to continue working in wheat breeding to meet the unavoidable changes in the environment.","climate change ; germplasm ; quality ; resilience ; wheat breeding",0,"Artigos em revista",1393076,Biociências,Scopus,N/A,"Instituto Nacional de Investigação Agrária e Veterinária (Lisbon, Portugal); University of Évora (Evora, Portugal); Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia da Universidade Nova de Lisboa (Caparica, Portugal); Universidad de Extremadura (Badajoz, Spain); Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal)",N/A,N/A,"Benvindo Maçãs; Rita Costa; Conceição Gomes; Ana Sofia Bagulho; Nuno Pinheiro; José Moreira; Armindo Costa; Manuel Patanita; José Dores; Sara Rodrigo","N/A; 0000-0002-2122-9950",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Foliar spraying enhanced to different extents Zn content in the grains of both genotypes, but the average of enrichment indexes varied among the wheat fields. Zinc mostly accumulated in the embryo and vascular bundle and to a lesser extent in the endosperm.

Treated CWW by the aforementioned process has been used for agricultural irrigation of two tomato cultivars (Roma and Rio Grande) after dilution with fresh water, which was used as control experiment (1.44dSm-1). Five different irrigation treatments, with salinity level in the range of 1.75-10.02dSm-1, were implemented with treated wastewater.

Nevertheless, the cultivar Rio Grande presented an increase up to 21% in the marketable yield, for salinity levels of 1.75-3.22dSm-1, owing to an increment of the fruit fresh weight. Furthermore, treatment significantly influenced the tomato yield with epidermis deformations by solar exposure, unit fruit fresh weight and tomato number per kilogram. Fruit epidermis deformations due to solar exposition were minimized in about 27-93% when using treated wastewater.

In this work, an alternative wastewater management option is suggested. The process includes the CWW pretreatment by means of a basic precipitation stage followed by neutralization of the supernatant. This pre-stage is capable of reducing the organic, suspended solids and fats content to different levels. In a second step, the pretreated CWW has been used in the irrigation of tomato crops (cv. Roma and cv. Rio Grande). Different salinity levels corresponding to 1.75, 2.22, 3.22, 5.02 and 10.02dSm-1 have been tested. Taking into account the obtained results in control runs (fresh water), the salinity level of the pretreated CWW had no significant effect on the flower clusters number per plant, tomatoes number per plant, tomatoes number per cluster, longitudinal and transversal calipers and epidermis firmness of the fruits. Moreover, an increment of soluble solid content in fruits (16% for cv. Roma and 27% for cv. Rio Grande) was observed in saline treatments. Among the drawbacks experienced after irrigation with high salinity level were some physiological disorders such as blossom-end rot. In this line, epidermis firmness and caliper reductions were observed compared to marketable fruit although cv. Rio Grande was less sensible to the aforementioned disorder. The effects of irrigation with pretreated CWW on the soil properties were also investigated. As expected, soil conductivity linearly increased with the pretreated CWW salinity level. Additionally, soil contents in phosphorus, nitrogen and organic matter were increased after the pretreated CWW irrigation. Under controlled saline conditions, the tomato plants irrigation can be a solution for by-products management from cheese industry with the fruits characteristics improvement and the wastewater inadequate discharge reduction. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Cheese whey wastewater reuse ; Fertirrigation ; Lycopersicon esculentum Mill. ; Salinity ; Soil ; Tomato quality",22,"Artigos em revista",,Biociências,Ambas,"INCT-EN (SFRH/BD/47559/2008) Instituto Nacional de Ciência e Tecnologia para Excitotoxicidade e Neuroproteção","Universidad de Extremadura (Badajoz, Spain); Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal)",N/A,N/A,"Ana R.

This alternative presents attractive advantages from the economic and pollution control viewpoints. Pretreated cheese whey wastewater (CWW) has high contents of biodegradable organic matter, salinity and nutrients, which are essential development factors for plants with moderate to elevated salinity tolerance. Five different pretreated CWW treatments (1.75 to 10.02dSm-1) have been applied in the tomato plant growth. Fresh water was used as a control run (average salinity level=1.44dSm-1). Chemical characterization and indicator ratios of the leaves, stems and roots were monitored. The sodium and potassium leaf concentrations increased linearly with the salinity level in both cultivars, Roma and Rio Grande. Similar results were found in the stem sodium content. However, the toxic sodium accumulations in the cv. Roma exceeded the values obtained in the cv. Rio Grande. In this last situation, K and Ca uptake, absorption, transport and accumulation capacities were presented as tolerance mechanisms for the osmotic potential regulation of the tissues and for the ion neutralization. Consequently, Na/Ca and Na/K ratios presented lower values in the cv. Rio Grande. Na/Ca ratio increased linearly with the salinity level in leaves and stems, regardless of the cultivar. Regarding the Na/K ratio, the values demonstrated competition phenomena between the ions for the cv. Rio Grande.

The analysis was based on collected wastewater quality data, including the values of the pollutant indicators BOD5 (biochemical oxygen demand), CODCr (chemical oxygen demand), and TSS (total suspended solids), in the 2017–2020 period. Anderson–Darling (A–D) statistics were applied to assess the fit of the theoretical distributions to the empirical distributions of the random variables under study. The selection of the best-fitting statistical distributions was determined using the percentage deviation (PBIAS) criterion. Based on the analyses that were performed, the best-fitting statistical distributions for the pollution indicators of the raw wastewater were the generalised extreme value distribution for BOD5, the Gaussian distribution for CODCr, and the log-normal distribution for TSS. For treated effluent, the log-normal distribution was the best fit for BOD5 and CODCr; the semi-normal distribution, for TSS. The new data generated using the Monte-Carlo method allowed the reliability of the VF-CW operation to be assessed by determining the reliability indices, i.e., the average efficiency of the removal of pollutants (η), the technological efficiency index (R), the reliability index (CR), and the risk index of the negative control of the sewage treatment plant operation (Re). The obtained results indicate that only in the case of CODCr, the analysed treatment facility may fail to meet the requirements related to the reduction of organic pollutants to the required level, which is evidenced by the values of the indicators CR = 1.10, R = 0.49, and η = 0.82. In addition, the risk index of the negative operation of the facility (Re) assumes a value of 1, which indicates that during the period of its operation, the VF-CW system will not operate with the required efficiency in relation to this indicator.

In addition, a great similarity was also observed between the calcined and the wetted sludges, both as a coagulant aid, for all the slaughterhouse wastewaters tested. However, the latter consumed more hydrated lime, more volume of sludge sedimented, and higher concentrations phosphorus and organic matter in the treated wastewater.

This may be due to the inflow of the Agua Forte stream, which has characteristics of Acid Mining Drainage (AMD). The objective of this study was to test the efficiency of heavy metal removal from the Agua Forte stream using the macrophyte floating bed technology (Vetiveria zizanioides and Phragmites australis) in a pilot plant, monitoring and evaluating the water quality and performance of macrophytes. Two experiments were carried out in 2019 over 6 months (January to June). Both experiments were performed in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tanks with the nominal capacity of 1 m3 each. The tanks were filled with about 0.8 m3 of water coming from the Agua Forte stream, which was renewed monthly. The floating beds consisted in a high-density polyethylene floating system and an organic plant support mat filled with a plant density of 285 plants m-2. The heavy metal removal rates obtained from the Vetiveria zizanioides and Phragmites australis floating bed were Fe = 40%; Zn = 33%; Cu = 23%; Mn = 14% and Fe = 27%; Zn = 19%; Mn = 17%; Cu = 14%; respectively. The order of heavy metals accumulation in Vetiveria zizanioides and Phragmites australis in plant biomass was Fe> Zn> Cu> Mn and Fe> Zn> Mn> Cu, respectively. The growth of Vetiveria zizanioides and Phragmites australis in leaf biomass was 7.1 ± 0.3 cm/month and 2.5 ± 0.0 cm/month and in root biomass 3.8 ± 0.1 cm/month and 4.1 ± 0.1 cm/month, respectively. The growth of macrophytes showed the ability to survive in the AMD-containing waters without severe damage in their external and anatomical morphology, although their growth suffered inhibition.

This paper presents a mathematical optimisation approach for an unequal area facility layout problem, applied in designing the backroom layout in grocery retail. A set of rectangular facilities (backroom departments) with given area requirements has to be placed, without overlapping, on a limited floor space (backroom area), which can have a regular or an irregular shape. The objective is to find the location and format of the storage departments, such that the walking distances in the store by store employees are minimised. The proposed approach is tested in a European grocery retailer. In the computational experiments, several real store layouts are compared with the ones suggested by the proposed model. The decrease in the walking distances is, on average, 30 percent. In order to understand what the current designers' strategy is, a set of scenarios was created and compared with the real layouts. Each scenario ignores a characteristic of the problem. The goal is to understand what aspect designers are currently discarding.

In this paper, we propose two mathematical programming formulations to solve the grocery backroom sizing problem. This problem consists of determining the dimension of each storage department in the backroom area to optimise its overall efficiency. The first formulation is a bottom-up approach that aims to reduce the backroom life-cycle costs by determining the optimum floor space and storage height for each department. The second is a top-down approach based on Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), which determines the efficient level of storage floor space for each backroom department, based on a comparison with the benchmarks observed among existing stores. Each approach has distinct characteristics that turn the models suitable for different retail contexts. We also describe the application of the proposed approaches to a case study of a European retailer. The application of this methodology in the design process demonstrated substantial potential for space savings (6% for the bottom-up model and 16% for the top-down model).

The term ""quality"" in fish refers to the index of freshness evaluation in accordance to the Regulation (EC) No. 2406/96 of November 26th, namely the esthetical appearance, freshness and degree of deterioration that the fish had suffered. Objective: To evaluate the freshness index, hygienic quality and bromatological composition of sardines in different commercial shops in Beja, Alentejo. Methods: Four different lots of Sardinha pilchardus were evaluated from the four commercial shops (20 sardines/lots), and classification was made of the category of each of the lots was carried out by the Reg. (EC) No. 2406/96 tables. Physical-chemical analysis was made: determination of Total Volatile Basic Nitrogen (TVB-N), refractive index of vitreous humor (RI), pH, colour, texture, bromatological analysis, and microbiological analysis. Results: TVB-N values for the different samples was lower than 14 mg/100g, as mentioned in Reg. (EC) No 1022/2008 it should be lower than 20 to 30mg/100g, and therefore the 4 samples respected that criteria. Microbiological analysis showed that the samples were within the acceptable values. The sardines presented average nutritional values of 161 Kcal/100g, which are lower than reference values from INSA (2007) nutritional table, eventually due to the low fat content by this time of the year (Spring). Conclusion: The sardines showed freshness categories of Extra and A, and hence emphasized a satisfactory state for consumption. The most expounding analyzes for the determination of freshness were the TVB-N, the instrumental texture and the Refraction Index.","nutritional value ; refraction index ; texture ; TVB-N",1,"Artigos em revista",,"Tecnologias CAplicadas",Scopus,N/A,"Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal); Universidad de Murcia (Murcia, Spain)",N/A,N/A,"Beatriz Diez; Maria João Barata Carvalho; Manuela Costa; Maria Periago; Silvina Ferro Palma","N/A; 0000-0001-9909-6345",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Ethanol added tempuras showed higher crispness and lower maximum force than their water counterparts in an instrumental texture evaluation. Fried squids coated with ethanol added tempuras were rated as crispier and crunchier, even after 2 days of storage and further reheating.

The phenomenon of population ageing translates into a significant increase in older adults and a decrease in the young population: in 2021, there would be 182 older adults for every 100 young people. Alongside ageing, multiple diseases and loss of functionality may arise, affecting the independence and self-care capacity of older adults. Empirically, institutionalisation leads to barriers in functionality, resulting from multiple emotional, physical and cognitive factors. Residential homes for older adults respond to institutionalisation and are often considered a predictor of dependency. Considering all the aspects previously explained, it becomes necessary to look at the quality of care in long-term care facilities and the models of care used in these elderly care facilities. Studies indicate that the assessment of the functional profile and self-care needs is crucial in the development of care models. Methods and design: A systematic literature review will be conducted. The following databases will be searched: CINAHL Plus with Full Text, MedicLatina, MEDLINE with Full Text, and Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection. The search strategy will include the following MesH or similar terms: Functional Profile, Self-Care, Older Persons, and Long-Term Care. The research will meet the timeline of January 2017 to August 2022. As inclusion criteria, only randomized studies with people aged 65 years or older with long-term care needs, written in English and Portuguese, will be included.

The source of the ion HSO5- is potassium monopersulphate (2KHSO5∙KHSO4∙K2SO4) (Oxone) that may be decomposed into radicals (OH., SO4-., SO5-.) by means of transition metal as Co(II). Different concentrations were used for both compounds and the combination ([Co2+] = 1.00μM/[HSO5-] = 5.00·10-2 M) achieved the highest COD removal (60%) and complete decomposition of the oxidant was verified for contact times of 45 min. This process has some advantages comparing to the conventional Fenton method such as the absence of the costly pH adjustment and the Fe(III) hydroxide sludge which characterize this treatment process. The Fenton process showed that the combination of [H2O2] = 2.00M/[Fe2+] = 0.70 M was the best and archived COD removal of 80%. The treatments studied in this research have achieved high COD removal, but the wastewater from the biodiesel purification stage presents very high parametric values of Chemical Oxygen Demand (667,000 mgO2/L), so the final COD concentration reached is still above the emission limit of discharge in surface water, according the Portuguese Law (Decree-Law 236/98).

For instance, it can be of interest to ensure reliability in a telecommunications network, to reduce the consequences of possible accidents in the transportation of hazardous materials or to decrease the risk of robberies in money distribution. All these applications involve the search for a set of paths that are as dissimilar as possible, with respect to the arcs in them. In this work, we present linear integer programming formulations that intend to find K dissimilar paths. The new models derive from a straightforward single-commodity flow formulation of the K paths problem, to which extra constraints are added to account for the concept of dissimilarity. In particular, in each formulation a different measure of the similarity between the K paths is minimized: the number of repeated arcs, the number of arc reuses and the number of pairwise arc overlaps. The third measure originates a non-linear model that is linearized through a discretized model reformulation technique. These formulations are complemented by a polynomial algorithm that allows to extract K loopless paths from the solutions output by each of them. The formulations are tested for random and grid networks with respect to the solutions’ average and minimum dissimilarity and the run time. Two of them stand out in terms of both those measures, when compared to an iterative approach from the literature. The best one regarding the average dissimilarity finds 20 paths with average dissimilarity of 99.5% in about 168 s for random networks of 5 000 nodes and 100 000 arcs. The same approach finds 20 paths for grid instances of size 100 × 100 in less than 18 s. The other formulation requires about 11 s for the same random instances, with a 0.7% deviation from the best known average dissimilarity; while it requires less than 7 s to compute 20 paths in 100 × 100 grids with a 0.6% deviation to the optimal dissimilarity.","Discretized formulations ; Dissimilarity ; Integer linear programming formulations ; K alternative paths",3,"Artigos em revista",105939,"Matemática CFisicas",Scopus,"FCT (CENTRO-01-0145-FEDER-029312) Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia","Center for Mathematical Studies (Lisbon, Portugal); University of Coimbra, Centre for Mathematics (Coimbra, Portugal); Politecnico di Milano (Milan, Italy); Universidade de Coimbra, Instituto de Engenharia de Sistemas E Computadores de Coimbra (Coimbra, Portugal); Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal)",N/A,N/A,"Ali Moghanni; Marta Pascoal; Maria Teresa Godinho","N/A; 0000-0003-0517-677X; 0000-0002-3377-9327",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

We start by reviewing well known natural formulations with some emphasis on the formulation by Picard and Queyranne (1978) [22]. The main feature of this formulation is that it uses, as a subproblem, an exact description of the n-circuit problem. Then, we present a new formulation that uses more variables and is based on using, for each node, a stronger subproblem, namely an n-circuit subproblem with the additional constraint that the corresponding node is not repeated in the circuit. Although the new model has more variables and constraints than the original PQ model, the results given from our computational experiments show that the linear programming relaxation of the new model gives, for many of the instances tested, gaps that are close to zero. Thus, the new model is worth investigating for solving TDTSP instances. We have also provided a complete characterization of the feasible set of the corresponding linear programming relaxation in the space of the variables of the PQ model.

The latter might, in turn, be divided into two classes: (b1) those restricting the length of the path from the depot to any node k, and (b2) those restricting the length of the circuit passing through any node k. Our results indicate that formulations based upon circuit lengths (b2) lead to models with a linear programming relaxation that is tighter than the linear programming relaxation of models based upon path lengths (b1), and that combining features from capacitated models with those of circuit lengths can lead to formulations for the CVRP with a tight linear programming bound.

However, raw milk products may be seen with reservations in terms of safety or technological defects. To overcome that, the addition of an autochthonous starter culture may ensure the cheesemaking process optimization and microbiota dominance. In this work, the technological and protective performance of eleven lactic acid bacteria strains, isolated from Serpa Protected Designation of Origin cheese and reported as generally recognized as safe, were screened. The integration of technological and protective properties studied in the PCA plot, coupled with the proteolytic and lipolytic analysis suggested that Lb. plantarum PL1 and PL4 strains may be the best candidates. These strains showed both proteolytic and lipolytic activities, a good acidification potential, low D-lactic acid production and were well adapted to the salt and temperatures used. PL1 strain also exhibited a higher antimicrobial effect against the pathogenic bacteria studied. Although Lb. paracasei strain showed lower acidification capacity, due to their technological and protective properties, it could be combined with other more acidifying strains. As future work, it is important to establish cheese model systems to complement this screening and implement an autochthonous starter culture.","Autochthonous starter culture ; Lactic acid bacteria ; Serpa PDO cheese ; Technological attributes",12,"Artigos em revista",112079,"Tecnologias CAplicadas",Scopus,"FCT (UIDB/50016/2020) Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia","Instituto Nacional de Investigação Agrária e Veterinária (Lisbon, Portugal); Escola Superior de Biotecnologia da Universidade Católica Portuguesa (Porto, Portugal); Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia da Universidade Nova de Lisboa (Caparica, Portugal); Universidad de Extremadura (Badajoz, Spain); Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal)",N/A,N/A,"Helena Araújo-Rodrigues; Maria Teresa P.G. dos Santos; Santiago Ruiz-Moyano; Freni K.

Accordingly, the development of an agronomic itinerary for Ca biofortification of Rocha pears and the assessment of physicochemical deviations prompted this study. Two orchards with contrasting soil and water characteristics were selected, characterized through orthophotomaping and, during fruits development, leaves were sprayed twice with Ca(NO3)2 (0.1, 0.3 and 0.6 kg ha−1) or CaCl2 (0.4, 0.8 and 1.6 kg ha−1), followed by pulverization only with CaCl2 (first once with 4 kg ha−1 and then four times with 8 kg ha−1). During fruits development net photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, transpiration rates, instantaneous and water use efficiency, only showed minor deviations, which indicated that the threshold of toxicity was not surpassed. Calcium contents varied during fruits development and at harvesting the average biofortification index varied between 47 %–63 % and 24 %–59 % in each of the orchards. Besides, the equatorial region of the fruits showed for all treatments (substantially in Ca treated samples) higher Ca contents in the epidermal and in the central regions. Fresh and heat-treated fruits (in a thermomix at 90 °C, during 10 min) biofortified with Ca only revealed minor differences and the sensory acceptability did not vary markedly. It is concluded that, although prevailing a heterogeneous distribution of Ca in fruit tissues, high indexes of biofortification in Rocha pears can be prompt in the orchards, without substantial physicochemical changes.

Irrespective of the producer, the yeast counts were around 5 log CFU/g in winter and, overall, were lower in spring. The yeast species identified at the end of ripening (30 days), using PCR-RFLP analysis and sequencing of the 26S rRNA, mainly corresponded to Debaryomyces hansenii and Kluyveromyces marxianus, with Candida spp. and Pichia spp. present to a lesser extent. The culture-independent results, obtained using high-throughput sequencing analysis, confirmed the prevalence of Debaryomyces spp. and Kluyveromyces spp. but, also, that Galactomyces spp. was relevant for three of the five producers, which indicates its importance during the early stages of the cheese ripening process, considering it was not found among the dominant viable yeast species. In addition, differences between the identified yeast isolated from cheeses obtained from PDO and non-PDO registered industries, showed that the lack of regulation of the cheese-making practice, may unfavourably influence the final yeast microbiota. The new knowledge provided by this study of the yeast diversity in Serpa cheese, could be used to modify the cheese ripening conditions, to favour desirable yeast species. Additionally, the prevalent yeast isolates identified, Debaryomyces hansenii and Kluyveromyces spp., may have an important role during cheese ripening and in the final sensorial characteristics.

Replacing NaCl with KCl reduced significantly the moisture content of cheeses up to 17 days of ripening, along with the expected parallel Na reduction/K increase contents. The sensory analysis indicated that a reduced-sodium São João cheese could be produced by using KCl as a partial to total NaCl replacer. However, the texture profile showed that hardness increased significantly while cohesiveness decreased significantly with the increasing substituting amount of KCl. Therefore, considering the sensory, physicochemical, and microbiological properties in combination to the textural results, cheeses formulated with (3:1) or (1:1) NaCl/KCl blends were considered as the most appropriate to be manufactured on an industrial scale.

Based on 16S ribosomal RNA screening by PCR, milk samples from all sheep were categorized as contaminated (n = 123) or noncontaminated (n = 104). For contaminated milk, different specific primers were used for pathogen identification (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, and Streptococcus uberis). Streptococcus agalactiae was identified as the most frequent agent. We further assessed whether contaminated versus noncontaminated samples were chemically different in terms of fat, protein, lactose, pH, and solids-not-fat.

Effects of main environmental and nutritional factors on the esterase activity of those psychrotrophic strains were investigated. Biomass level, pH, lactose concentration and permanent agitation affected positively esterase activity of each strain. However, the addition of Tween 20 influenced it negatively. Finally, and in order to extract information from the data sets, principal components analysis was applied to the data sets. The first two principal components showed a clear discrimination between Pseudomonas fluorescens and Pseudomonas cepacia.","Esterasic activity ; Gram negative bacteria ; Optimisation ; Raw milk",5,"Artigos em revista",,"Tecnologias CAplicadas",Scopus,N/A,"Ecole Supérieure des Industries Alimentaires de Tunis (Tunis, Tunisia); Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal)",N/A,N/A,"Olfa Ben Moussa; Melika Mankaï; Chokry Barbana; Mnasser Hassouna; Nuno Bartolomeu Alvarenga; João Canada","N/A; 0000-0003-0625-0687",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

(2) Methods: A total of 100 participants (77.1 ± 7.36 years, 73% women) were included in the study. In a first phase, the Portuguese SARC-F was adapted following the standardized forward–backward translation procedure, and internal consistency as well as inter-rater and test–retest reliability of the Portuguese SARC-F were analyzed. Secondly, clinical validation was evaluated by comparing the SARC-F total score with five operational definitions of sarcopenia and with other sarcopenia-related measurements. Discriminant validity, with respect to low muscle mass and strength and physical function were analyzed. (3) Results: The Portuguese SAR-F showed acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach α = 0.82), excellent inter-rater reliability (total score), and substantial to excellent test–retest reliability (ICC = 0.891 for the total score). Specificity ranged from 72.5% (FNIH) to 73.4 (IGWS), and negative predictive values went from 91.8% (EWGSOP1) to 97.3% (FNIH), but low sensitivity and positive predictive value were observed. The Portuguese SARC-F showed a moderate ability to discriminate people with low muscle strength (AUC = 0.78) and gait speed (AUC = 0.89). (4) Conclusions: The Portuguese SARC-F is a valid and reliable tool for ruling out sarcopenia in community-dwelling older adults and can discriminate between people with low handgrip strength and gait speed.","Portuguese ; psychometric ; SARC-F ; sarcopenia ; validation",1,"Artigos em revista",1096,"Artes H Desporto",Scopus,N/A,"Universidade de Lisboa (Lisbon, Portugal); Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal); Universidad de Jaén (Jaen, Spain); SPRINT—Sport Physical activity and health Research &amp; INnovation CenTter (Beja, Portugal)",N/A,N/A,"Margarida Isabel Boteta-Gomes; Agustín Aibar-Almazán; Fidel Hita-Contreras; Nuno Eduardo Marques de Loureiro; Vânia Azevedo Ferreira Brandão-Loureiro","0000-0002-7889-5735; 0000-0002-9386-9199; 0000-0001-7215-5456; 0000-0002-1166-3219; N/A",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Methods: A cross-sectional, observational study was conducted on 167 women (63.85 ± 9.36 years). The Menopause Rating Scale was used to evaluate the menopausal symptoms severity, while the Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire was employed to assess the localization of the musculoskeletal pain, and multi-located pain was determined if two or more body regions were affected. Depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), age, body mass index (BMI) and physical activity level were considered as potential confounders. Results: A greater severity of the somato-vegetative menopausal symptoms was related to the prevention from usual activities because of pain in the neck, shoulders, elbows, wrists/hands and knees (R2 of Nagelkerke = 0.064, 0.043, 0.074, 0.045 and 0.045, respectively). Associations were also observed between greater age and pain in the knees, ankles and feet (R2 of Nagelkerke = 0.036 and 0.034, respectively), and being physically inactive with upper back pain (R2 of Nagelkerke = 0.060).

Objective: Describe the quality of life related to health and verify its association with the occurrence of falls and functional mobility of Portuguese elderly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Descriptive observational study. Participants were 182 older adults, aged > 65 years (85.7% female; age 72.7 ± 6.7 years), from Baixo Alentejo, Portugal. Quality of life was assessed using the SF-36 questionnaire (Portuguese version) and we explored the relationships between their eight domains and the occurrence of falls and functional mobility (TUG). Results: We found significant associations between quality of life and gender, occurrence of falls and mobility. The analysis of the dimensions SF-36 revealed that a more positive perception of SM (73.1%) is associated with the female gender. A more positive perception of FF (73.1%), DC (53.3%), FS (74.7%), DE (45.1%) and SM (72.5%) is associated with non-occurrence of falls, and it was found that a more positive perception of FF (82.3%) and DE (53.2%) is associated with good mobility. Conclusion: It was found that a better perception of FF, FS, DE, SN and DC are related to the non-occurrence of falls. Also, a good perception of FF and DE are related to good mobility.

Methods: A sample of 169 older adults living in Croatia, Greece, Portugal, and Poland (mean age = 72.2 ± 6.0, 68% female) had valid objective physical activity and sedentary behaviour data collected in different seasons of the year: spring and autumn/winter. Physical activity and sedentary behaviour were collected with accelerometers (ActiGraph, GT3X), over 7 consecutive days, in both periods. A valid record was defined as at least two weekdays and one weekend day with 10 hours of wearing time. Analyses were performed with IBM SPSS 28.0, using t-test, ANOVA, and binary logistic regressions. Results: Most older adults from the four countries met the physical activity guidelines in spring and autumn/winter. No significant variations were found across seasons for sedentary behaviour and physical activity both for light and vigorous intensity, regardless of sex, country, education, and body mass index (BMI). A decline in moderate physical activity intensity from spring to autumn/winter was found for those with lower education and higher BMI. Conclusion: The promotion of physical activity must be considered in programs to promote healthy aging throughout the year, especially considering the moderate intensity and those populations with higher BMI and lower educational levels.","elderly ; health ; physical activity ; seasonality ; sedentary behaviour",1,"Artigos em revista",2395,"Artes H Desporto",Scopus,"EC (622623-EPP-1-2020-1-DE-SPO-SCP) European Commission","College of Business and Economics (Johannesburg, South Africa); University of Zagreb, Faculty of Kinesiology (Zagreb, Croatia); Faculdade de Motricidade Humana, Universidade de Lisboa (Cruz Quebrada - Dafundo, Portugal); Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa (Lisbon, Portugal); Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal); Politechnika Krakowska (Krakow, Poland); Technische Universität Berlin (Berlin, Germany); Università degli Studi di Sassari (Sassari, Italy); Middle School Üzümlü (Malatya, Turkey); Spor Elcileri Dernegi (SPELL) (Malatya, Turkey); 🇬🇷 NORTHERN GREECE PHYSICAL EDUCATION TEACHERS ASSOCIATION (Thessaloniki, Greece); 🇮🇹 MINE VAGANTI NGO (Sassari, Italy)",N/A,N/A,"João Martins; Houshmand Masoumi; Vânia Loureiro; Margarida Gomes; Fortunata Ratinho; Tiago Ribeiro; Melika Mehriar; Marija Rakovac; Davor Šentija; Andrzej Bahr; Marta Tomczyk; Wojciech Dynowski; Roberto Solinas; Maria Grazia Pirina; Donatella Coradduzza; Giannangelo Boccuzzi; Birol Çağan; Ahmet Dalcı; Athanasios Papageorgiou; Soultana Smaga; Georgios Parisopoulos; Georgios Patsakas; Ioannis Meimaridis; Nuno Loureiro; Adilson Marques","0000-0002-2540-6678; 0000-0003-2843-4890; N/A; 0000-0002-7889-5735; 0000-0001-5602-048X; 0000-0001-7303-1316; 0000-0003-0098-4938; 0009-0006-8176-0811; 0009-0003-1906-9761; 0000-0002-8978-0490; 0000-0001-7428-3865; 0000-0002-1166-3219; 0000-0001-9850-7771",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Methods A cross-sectional, observational study was conducted on 363 women (66.21 ± 9.00 y) from several Portuguese and Spanish locations. The Menopause Rating Scale was used to evaluate the severity of menopausal symptoms, while the Falls Efficacy Scale-International and Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale-16 items were used to assess balance confidence and fear of falling, respectively. Anxiety and depression (evaluated by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), age, time since the onset of menopause, body mass index, history of falls, osteoporosis, smoking habit, physical activity level, and nocturia were considered as potential confounders. Independent associations were analyzed after adjusting for potential confounding variables. Student's t test, bivariate correlations, and multivariate linear regression analysis were performed. Results A total of 363 women (66.21 ± 9.00 y) participated in the study, 192 from Portugal and 171 from Spain. Linear regression analysis indicates that more severe menopausal symptoms at a somatovegetative level (beta coefficient [β] = -0.25; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], -2.09 to -0.81; P = <0.001), a higher body mass index (β = -0.16; 95% CI, -1.22 to -0.22; P = 0.005), and osteoporosis (β = 0.14; 95% CI, 1.36 to 10.08; P = 0.010) were associated with lower balance confidence values.

Physical activity (PA) brings cognitive, mental and physical improvements in adolescents, benefiting physical fitness (PF), cognitive results and mental health. Aim of Study. The present study aimed to analyze and characterize the level of PA, PF and attention in adolescents. Material and Methods. A descriptive cross-sectional study was performed. Forty-three adolescents aged 16 to 18 years old (16.77 ± 0.61 years), where 53.5% (n = 23) were boys participated in the study. An international questionnaire was used to accessed PA and PF levels. The CAD-S Assessment Scale revised version was used to evaluate the level of attention. Standard statistical methods were used to calculate means, standard deviations, and chi-square test. Results. The results show a moderate level of PA practice in adolescents (60.5%) and a high level of PA in boys, whom have also a good perception of their PF level 53.5% (p ≤ 0.05). In the attention capacity, high levels in the adolescents (79.1%) were observed. Conclusions. The adolescents have a good perception of their PA and PF levels, showing positive perception on cognitive function. The practice of PA daily at school and extracurricular contexts seems to be essential to obtain high levels of PF and attention, contributing to better academic performance and life quality.","attention ; concentration ; exercise ; school ; teens",5,"Artigos em revista",,"Artes H Desporto",Scopus,N/A,"Centro de Investigação em Desporto, Saúde e Desenvolvimento Humano (Vila Real, Portugal); Universitatea Transilvania din Brașov (Brasov, Romania); University of Mohaghegh Ardabili (Ardabil, Iran); Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal); Universidade da Beira Interior (Covilha, Portugal); Instituto de Saúde Ambiental (Lisbon, Portugal)",N/A,N/A,"Ana Ruivo Alves; Renata Dias; Henrique P.

A multivariate linear regression was performed, with body mass index, waist to hip ratio, age and fall history as possible confounders. Our findings showed that a greater severity of the menopausal symptoms at a psychological level was associated, under both eyes open and closed conditions, with worse postural control assessed by the length of the stabilogram (adjusted R2 = 0.093 and 0.91, respectively), the anteroposterior center of pressure displacements (adjusted R2 = 0.051 and 0.031, respectively) and the center of pressure velocity (adjusted R2 = 0.065 for both conditions).

We argue that, in inertial Alfvénic turbulence, both energy and generalized kinetic helicity exhibit direct cascades. We demonstrate that the two cascades are compatible due to the existence of a strong scale dependence of the phase alignment angle between velocity and magnetic field fluctuations, with the phase alignment angle scaling as cosαk∝k⊥-1. The kinetic and magnetic energy spectra scale as ∝k⊥-5/3 and ∝k⊥-11/3, respectively. As a result of the dual direct cascade, the generalized helicity spectrum scales as ∝k⊥-5/3, implying progressive balancing of the turbulence as the cascade proceeds to smaller scales in the k⊥de≫1 range. Turbulent eddies exhibit a phase-space anisotropy k∥∝k⊥5/3, consistent with critically balanced inertial Alfvén fluctuations.

Thermal power-balance estimates computed by TRANSP as well as the shape of the high-k density fluctuation wavenumber spectrum and the fluctuation level ratio between strongly driven and weakly driven ETG-turbulence conditions can be matched by nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations and a synthetic diagnostic for high-k scattering. Linear gyrokinetic simulations suggest that the ion-scale instability in the weak ETG condition is close to the critical threshold for the kinetic ballooning mode instability, and nonlinear ion-scale gyrokinetic simulations show that turbulence might be in a state reminiscent of a Dimits' shift regime, opening speculation on the role that ion-scale turbulence might play for the weak ETG condition.

Active commuting to school is a low-cost and sustainable behaviour that promotes adolescents’ physical activity levels. Despite its importance, data on low-and middle-income countries is scarce. This study aimed to assess the relationship between active commuting to school and physical activity (PA) levels among 11–16 years-old adolescents from 63 low-and middle-income countries and six world regions. Methods: Data were from the GSHS database. Participants were 187,934 adolescents (89,550 boys), aged 11– 16 years-old, from 63 low-and middle-income countries. Active commuting to school and PA were self-reported as the number of days adolescents walked or cycled to school and engaged in physical activity for at least 60 min in the past 7 days. Results: Boys and girls who actively commuted to school presented higher prevalence of attaining the PA recommendations, but only for the 13–14 (boys: 16.6% versus 22.0%; girls: 9.8% versus 14.6%) and 15–16 (boys: 16.3% versus 21.6%; girls: 8.0% versus 14.0%) year-old age groups. Only for Oceania, Central Asian, Middle Eastern, and North African girls and Sub-Saharan African boys no difference was found in the prevalence of attaining the PA recommendations between those who actively commuted to school and those who did not. Boys who actively commuted to school were 42% (95% CI: 1.37, 1.46) more likely to achieve the PA recommendations, while girls were 66% (95% CI: 1.59, 1.73) more likely to achieve the PA recommendations. Conclusions: Active commuting to school is associated with the adolescents’ physical activity levels. However, it may have a lesser influence in helping younger adolescents attaining physical activity recommendations.

Quantitative comparisons between high-k fluctuation measurements (Smith et al 2008 Rev. Sci. Instrum. 79 123501) and simulations are performed via a novel synthetic high-k diagnostic. Computationally intensive electron-scale simulations featuring an unusually large domain (L r, L θ) ∼ (20, 20)ρ s are shown to be required for accurate deployment of the synthetic diagnostic. Ion thermal transport is shown to be close to neoclassical levels, consistent with stable ion-scale turbulence simulations conducted with the GYRO code (Candy and Waltz 2003 J. Comput. Phys. 186 545). Electron-scale GYRO simulations are shown to match the thermal power-balance estimates from TRANSP. The frequency spectra characteristics of electron-scale turbulence (spectral peak and width) can be consistently reproduced by the synthetic spectra, but these reveal not to be a critical constraint on the simulation model. The shape of the high-k wavenumber spectrum and the fluctuation level ratio between the strong and weak ETG conditions can also be simultaneously matched by electron-scale simulations within sensitivity scans about the experimental profile values, and result to be great discriminators of the turbulence models analyzed. Together, electron thermal power comparisons and quantitative agreement of electron-scale turbulence spectra give strong evidence supporting electron-scale ETG fluctuations as the main mechanism driving anomalous electron thermal transport in the two outer-core conditions of the modest-beta NSTX H-mode analyzed.","electron-scale turbulence ; gyrokinetic simulation ; high-k scattering ; synthetic diagnostic ; validation",9,"Artigos em revista",115015,"Artes H Desporto",Scopus,N/A,"Center for Energy Research (La Jolla, United States); University of Wisconsin-Madison (Madison, United States); Plasma Science and Fusion Center (Cambridge, United States); Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (Princeton, United States); University of California, Davis (Davis, United States); General Atomics (San Diego, United States)",N/A,N/A,"J.

Methods: A nationally representative sample of 6018 girls between 11 and 13 years and 3838 girls between 15 and 17 years was drawn from the Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children surveys in 2002, 2006, 2010, and 2014. A questionnaire was used to collect data of MVPA. Data were assessed with analysis of variance, t test, chi square, and chi-square test for trend. Results: The percentage of 11- to 13-year-old girls reporting 60 minutes of daily MVPA was low and stable between 2002 (9.5%) and 2014 (11.1%) (P = .21), such as for girls aged 15-17 years (2002 = 5.6%, 2014 = 5%, P = .81). The percentage of girls reporting 60 minutes MVPA decreased significantly among age groups in all year surveys. A significant decrease in correlation with age across the same generation of adolescents was also found. Conclusion: This study points out that the prevalence of Portuguese girls meeting the PA guidelines is low, declines with age, and is stable from 2002-2014. Therefore, different strategies to prevent MVPA decline and promote MVPA are needed since childhood.","Exercise ; Gender ; Health behavior ; Public health ; Youth",14,"Artigos em revista",,"Artes H Desporto",Scopus,"HBS  Harvard Business School","Faculdade de Motricidade Humana, Universidade de Lisboa (Cruz Quebrada - Dafundo, Portugal); ISPA - Instituto Universitário (Lisbon, Portugal); Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa (Lisbon, Portugal); Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal); Lusófona University (Lisbon, Portugal)",N/A,N/A,"João Martins; Adilson Marques; Nuno Loureiro; Francisco Carreiro Da Costa; José Diniz; Margarida Gaspar De Matos","N/A; 0000-0002-1166-3219",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

The central result of this numerical analysis is the emergence of a self-induced turbulent regime in the saturation state of the collisionless MRI, which can only be captured for large enough simulation domains. One of the underlying mechanisms for the development of this turbulent state is the drift-kink instability (DKI) of the current sheets resulting from the nonlinear evolution of the channel modes. The onset of the DKI can only be observed for simulation domain sizes exceeding several linear MRI wavelengths. The DKI and ensuing magnetic reconnection activate the turbulent motion of the plasma in the late stage of the nonlinear evolution of the MRI. At steady-state, the magnetic energy has an MHD-like spectrum with a slope of k -5/3 for kρ < 1 and k -3 for sub-Larmor scale (kρ > 1). We also examine the role of the collisionless MRI and associated magnetic reconnection in the development of pressure anisotropy. We study the stability of the system due to this pressure anisotropy, observing the development of mirror instability during the early-stage of the MRI. We further discuss the importance of magnetic reconnection for particle acceleration during the turbulence regime. In particular, consistent with reconnection studies, we show that at late times the kinetic energy presents a characteristic slope of -2 in the high-energy region.","accretion, accretion disks ; instabilities ; magnetic reconnection ; plasmas ; turbulence",14,"Artigos em revista",149,"Artes H Desporto",Scopus,"NSF (1654168) National Science Foundation","Iscte – Instituto Universitário de Lisboa (Lisbon, Portugal); Plasma Science and Fusion Center (Cambridge, United States); Instituto Superior Técnico (Lisbon, Portugal)",N/A,N/A,"Giannandrea Inchingolo; Thomas Grismayer; Nuno F.

This study aimed to provide current data regarding the prevalence of overweight and obesity of adults, from 20 European countries. Methods: Participants were 34 814 (16 482 men) adults with mean age 50.817.7. Data from European Social Survey round 7, 2014, were analysed. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated from self-reported height and weight. Results: The proportion of underweight was only 2%, and 44.9% for normal weight. Overweight and obese accounted for 53.1%. More men than women were overweight (44.7% vs. 30.5%). Older adults were significantly more overweight (42.4%) and obese (20.9%) than middle age and younger adults. Retired people account for a greater proportion of overweight (42.0%) and obese (21.5%), when compared with employed, unemployed and students. People from rural areas were significantly more overweight (39.1 vs. 36.1%) and obese (17.0 vs. 15.3%) than those who lived in urban areas. The estimates indicate that the highest prevalence of overweight was in Czech Republic (45.2%), Hungary (43.7%) and Lithuania (41.7%). For obesity, Slovenia (20.8%), Estonia (19.7%) and the United Kingdom (19.2%) were the countries with the highest prevalence.

Magnetic reconnection occurs during the interaction of continuous and steady flows of super-Alfvénic, magnetized, aluminum plasma, which collide in a geometry with two-dimensional symmetry, producing a stable and long-lasting reconnection layer. Optical Thomson scattering measurements show that when the layer forms, ions inside the layer are more strongly heated than electrons, reaching temperatures of Ti∼ZTe≳300 eV - much greater than can be expected from strong shock and viscous heating alone. Later in time, as the plasma density in the layer increases, the electron and ion temperatures are found to equilibrate, and a constant plasma temperature is achieved through a balance of the heating mechanisms and radiative losses of the plasma.

In this paper, we propose an extension of the theory of reconnection-mediated turbulence to plasmas which are so weakly collisional that the reconnection occurring in the turbulent eddies is caused by electron inertia rather than by resistivity. We find that the transition scale to reconnection-mediated turbulence depends on the plasma beta and on the assumptions of the plasma turbulence model.

The models considered include a first-principles fully kinetic (FK) description, two widely used reduced models (gyrokinetic (GK) and hybrid-kinetic (HK) with fluid electrons), and a novel reduced gyrokinetic approach (KREHM). Two different ion beta (i) regimes are considered: 0.1 and 0.5. For bi = 0.5, good agreement between the GK and FK models is found at scales ranging from the ion to the electron gyroradius, thus providing firm evidence for a kinetic Alfven cascade scenario. In the same range, the HK model produces shallower spectral slopes, presumably due to the lack of electron Landau damping. For βi = 0.1, a detailed analysis of spectral ratios reveals a slight disagreement between the GK and FK descriptions at kinetic scales, even though kinetic Alfven fluctuations likely still play a significant role. The discrepancy can be traced back to scales above the ion gyroradius, where the FK and HK results seem to suggest the presence of fast magnetosonic and ion Bernstein modes in both plasma beta regimes, but with a more notable deviation from GK in the low-beta case. The identified practical limits and strengths of reduced-kinetic approximations, compared here against the FK model on a case-by-case basis, may provide valuable insight into the main kinetic effects at play in turbulent collisionless plasmas, such as the solar wind.","plasmas ; solar wind ; turbulence",57,"Artigos em revista",28,"Artes H Desporto",Scopus,"NSF (1654168) National Science Foundation","Università di Pisa (Pisa, Italy); University of California, Los Angeles (Los Angeles, United States); Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics (Garching bei Munchen, Germany); Plasma Science and Fusion Center (Cambridge, United States)",N/A,N/A,"Daniel Grošelj; Silvio S.

In the plane perpendicular to the local mean magnetic field, this implies that such eddies become current-sheetlike structures at small scales. We analyze the role of magnetic reconnection in these structures and conclude that reconnection becomes important at a scale λ∼LSL-4/7, where SL is the outer-scale (L) Lundquist number and λ is the smallest of the field-perpendicular eddy dimensions.

Two main applications of these equations are magnetized (Alfvénic) plasma turbulence and magnetic reconnection. Viriato uses operator splitting (Strang or Godunov) to separate the dynamics parallel and perpendicular to the ambient magnetic field (assumed strong). Along the magnetic field, Viriato allows for either a second-order accurate MacCormack method or, for higher accuracy, a spectral-like scheme composed of the combination of a total variation diminishing (TVD) third order Runge-Kutta method for the time derivative with a 7th order upwind scheme for the fluxes. Perpendicular to the field Viriato is pseudo-spectral, and the time integration is performed by means of an iterative predictor-corrector scheme. In addition, a distinctive feature of Viriato is its spectral representation of the parallel velocity-space dependence, achieved by means of a Hermite representation of the perturbed distribution function.

Two methods for obtaining estimates of perceived egocentric distance were used: verbal reports and visually directed motion toward a memorized visual target. For the latter method, because normal walking is not possible in 0 g, blindfolded subjects translated toward the visual target by pulling on a rope with their arms. The results showed that distance estimates using both verbal reports and blind pulling were significantly different between normal gravity, microgravity, and hypergravity. Compared to the 1 g measurements, the estimates of perceived distance using blind pulling were shorter for all distances in 1.8 g, whereas in 0 g they were longer for distances up to 4 m and shorter for distances beyond.

Reconnection is as ubiquitous as plasmas themselves, with solar flares perhaps the most popular example. Other fascinating processes where reconnection plays a key role include the magnetic dynamo, geomagnetic storms and the sawtooth crash in tokamaks. Over the last few years, the theoretical understanding of magnetic reconnection in large-scale fluid systems has undergone a major paradigm shift. The steady-state model of reconnection described by the famous Sweet-Parker (SP) theory, which dominated the field for ∼50 years, has been replaced with an essentially time-dependent, bursty picture of the reconnection layer, dominated by the continuous formation and ejection of multiple secondary islands (plasmoids). Whereas in the SP model reconnection was predicted to be slow, a major implication of this new paradigm is that reconnection in fluid systems is fast (i.e. independent of the Lundquist number), provided that the system is large enough. This conceptual shift hinges on the realization that SP-like current layers are violently unstable to the plasmoid (tearing) instability - implying, therefore, that such current sheets are super-critically unstable and thus can never form in the first place. This suggests that the formation of a current sheet and the subsequent reconnection process cannot be decoupled, as is commonly assumed. This paper provides an introductory-level overview of the recent developments in reconnection theory and simulations that led to this essentially new framework. We briefly discuss the role played by the plasmoid instability in selected applications, and describe some of the outstanding challenges that remain at the frontier of this subject. Amongst these are the analytical and numerical extension of the plasmoid instability to (i) 3D and (ii) non-magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) regimes. New results are reported in both cases.","magnetic reconnection ; MHD ; plasmoids",121,"Artigos em revista",014021,"Artes H Desporto",Scopus,"NSF (1411879) National Science Foundation","Instituto Superior Técnico (Lisbon, Portugal); University of Colorado Boulder (Boulder, United States)",N/A,N/A,"N.

The mechanical properties can be optimized by varying the PHA contents of the blend. The flexural and tensile properties were estimated by different models: the rule of mixtures, Kerner-Uemura-Takayanagi (KUT) model, Nicolai-Narkis model and Béla-Pukánsky model. This study was aimed at investigating the adhesion between the two material phases. The results anticipate a good adhesion between both phases. Nevertheless, for low levels of incorporation of PHA (up to 30%), where PLA is expectantly the matrix, the experimental data seem to deviate from the perfect adhesion models, suggesting a decrease in the adhesion between both polymeric phases when PHA is the disperse phase. For the tensile modulus, a linear relationship is found, following the rules of mixtures (or a KUT model with perfect adhesion between phases) denoting a good adhesion between the phases over the composition range. The incorporation of PHA in the blend leads to a decrease in the flexural modulus but, at the same time, increases the tensile modulus. The impact energy of the blends varies more than 157% over the entire composition. For blends with PHA weight fraction lower than 50%, the impact strength of the blend is higher than the pure base polymers. The highest synergetic effect is found when the PLA is the matrix and the PHA is the disperse phase for the blend PHA/PLA of 30/70. The second maximum is found for the inverse composition of 70/30. PLA has a heat-deflection temperature (HDT) substantially lower than PHA. For the blends, the HDT increases with the increment in the percentage of the incorporation of PHA. With up to 50% PHA (PLA as matrix), the HDT is practically constant and equal to PLA value. Above this point (PHA matrix), the HDT of the polymer blends increases linearly with the percentage of addition of PHA.","biodegradable blends ; Mechanical characterization ; PHA ; PLA ; polymer blend",25,"Artigos em revista",,"Artes H Desporto",Scopus,"FCT (MIT-Pt/EDAM-SMS/0030/2008) Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia","Universidade do Minho (Braga, Portugal); Universidade do Porto (Porto, Portugal)",N/A,N/A,"N.

The event provided 124 participants from all backgrounds a risk-free environment for pitching and validating their space business ideas. During the three days, 11 teams in Bremen and seven in Shanghai were formed. Mentors with significant technical, managerial, entrepreneurial and policy experience guided the participants through these intense three days. The event ended with a short five minute pitch to a panel of judges followed by a prize ceremony. A number of workshops and keynote speeches were held during the event providing participants with critical skills and motivation needed to succeed within the space sector. Statistics from the event show that both locations attracted significant amount of international participants of which Bremen catered towards young professionals and Shanghai towards university students. Following StartupWeekend Space, more than 50% of the teams from Bremen are continuing their projects five months after the event whereas no teams in Shanghai are continuing. This difference can be attributed to the demographic of participants in Shanghai which had little to no expertise in the space sector and a majority of whom had committed obligations towards their academic studies.

Analyzing the data from the dart impact test, the irregular fiber distribution for fiber ratio over than 20% is confirmed. The highest synergetic effect is found for fiber ratio of 20%. The incorporation of fiber improves the Heat Deflection Temperature (HDT) of the matrix when the fiber presents a homogeneous distribution through the matrix.

A local analysis is performed taking into account the dependence of a generic equilibrium profile on the outflow coordinate. The plasmoid instability [Loureiro, Phys. Plasmas 14, 100703 (2007)] is recovered, i.e., current sheets are unstable to the formation of a large-wave-number chain of plasmoids (kmaxLCS∼S3/8, where k max is the wave number of fastest growing mode, S=L CSVA/η is the Lundquist number, LCS is the length of the sheet, VA is the Alfvén speed, and η is the plasma resistivity), which grows super Alfvénically fast (γmaxτA∼S1/4, where γmax is the maximum growth rate, and τA=L CS/VA). For typical background profiles, the growth rate and the wave number are found to increase in the outflow direction. This is due to the presence of another mode, the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability, which is triggered at the periphery of the layer, where the outflow velocity exceeds the Alfvén speed associated with the upstream magnetic field. The KH instability grows even faster than the plasmoid instability γ maxτA∼kmaxLCS∼S 1/2. The effect of viscosity (ν) on the plasmoid instability is also addressed. In the limit of large magnetic Prandtl numbers Pm=ν/η, it is found that γmax∼S1/4Pm-5/8 and kmaxLCS∼S3/8Pm-3/16, leading to the prediction that the critical Lundquist number for plasmoid instability in the Pm ≫ 1 regime is Scrit∼104Pm1/2.

In the longer term it would enable the development of extra-terrestrial human habitats in the inner solar system. Following the Operations And Service Infrastructure for Space (OASIS) project, this paper describes in greater details the establishment and development of the second node of the network, on the Moon. Node 2 is based in the Lunar South Pole, where trapped water in craters, almost constant illumination on the craters' rim, and small temperature gradients offer the best environment. Initially unmanned, the lunar outpost is composed of a spaceport to land and launch vehicles safely, a power plant, and an in situ resources processing plant. Water is extracted and sent to node 1 in Low Earth Orbit and is also separated on site into hydrogen and oxygen, which can be used as propellant for various spacecraft and to support habitation and human operations. Other lunar volatiles trapped in the near sub surface include N 2, usable for habitat atmosphere generation and for plant growth medium, H2, and other carbon compounds. Additionally ilmenite, a common lunar mineral, can be used to produce titanium, oxygen and manufacture semiconducting devices such as photovoltaic cells. Critical technologies, such as regolith excavators and the Moon shuttle, with their concepts of operations, requirements, functions, and design are detailed. The business model and rationale for node 2 in the frame of the network of spaceports, as well as the law and policy framework are described comprehensively.

Using a twisting mode representation in sheared slab geometry, the characteristic equations have been formulated for a dissipative fluid model, developed rigorously from the gyrokinetic equation. They clearly show that perpendicular flow shear convects perturbations along the field at a speed we denote by Mcs (where cs is the sound speed), whilst parallel flow shear enters as an instability driving term analogous to the usual temperature and density gradient effects. For sufficiently strong perpendicular flow shear, M > 1, the propagation of the system characteristics is unidirectional and no unstable eigenmodes may form. Perturbations are swept along the field, to be ultimately dissipated as they are sheared ever more strongly. Numerical studies of the equations also reveal the existence of stable regions whenM < 1, where the driving terms conflict. However, in both cases transitory perturbations exist, which could attain substantial amplitudes before decaying. Indeed, for M »1, they are shown to exponentiate √M times.

Physics-based assumptions are used to derive a convergent iterative formulation of the SI scheme which enables the monitoring and control of the error introduced by the SI operator. This iteration essentially turns a semi-implicit method into a fully implicit method. Accuracy, rather than stability, determines the timestep. The scheme is second order accurate and shown to be equivalent to a simple preconditioning method. We show how the diffusion operators can be handled so as to yield the property of robust damping, i.e. dissipating the solution at all values of the parameter D Δ t, where D is a diffusion operator and Δt the timestep. The overall scheme remains second order accurate even if the advection and diffusion operators do not commute. In the limit of no physical dissipation, and for a linear test wave problem, the method is shown to be symplectic. The method is tested on the problem of Kinetic Alfvén wave mediated magnetic reconnection. A Fourier (pseudo-spectral) representation is used. A two-field gyrofluid model is used and an efficacious k-space SI operator for this problem is demonstrated. CPU speed-up factors over a CFL-limited explicit algorithm ranging from ∼20 to several hundreds are obtained, while accurately capturing the results of an explicit integration. Possible extension of these results to a real-space (grid) discretization is discussed. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

If the aspect ratio of the current sheet is sufficiently large, the sheet can itself become tearing-mode unstable, giving rise to secondary islands, which then coalesce with the original island.

Seven bread formulations were prepared: reference recipe (control) and six experimental formulations. The effect of the loaf size and the baking conditions was also tested. Finally, the effect of storage was tested by keeping control breads under different storage conditions (temperature/time). Moisture and resistant starch contents were evaluated in all breads. A higher level of moisture in the dough and a larger loaf size enhanced the RS content. An extended baking process also favored significantly the formation of RS. Storing the bread at room temperature for 3 days was shown to further increase the RS content.

Total and bioavailable As, Cu, Pb, and Zn concentrations were analyzed in the soils, and the same TE were analyzed in three different vegetables, lettuce (Lactuca sativa), coriander (Coriandrum sativum), and cabbage (Brassica oleracea), collected at the same locations. The soils were contaminated with As, Cu, Pb, and Zn, since their total concentrations exceeded the considered soil quality guideline values for plant production in the majority of the sampling sites. The maximum total concentrations for those TE were extremely high in some of the sampling sites (e.g. 1851mgAskg-1 in São Domingos, 1126mgCukg-1 in Aljustrel, 4946mgPbkg-1 in São Domingos, and 1224mgZnkg-1 in Aljustrel). However, the soils were mainly circumneutral, a factor that contributes to their low bioavailable fractions. As a result, generally, the plants contained levels of these elements characteristic of uncontaminated plants, and accumulation factors for all elements <1, typical of excluder plants. Furthermore, the estimated daily intake (EDI) for Cu and Zn, through the consumption of these vegetables, falls below the recommended upper limit for daily intake of these elements. The sampling site that stood out from the others was located at São João de Negrilhos (Aljustrel), where bioavailable Zn levels were higher, a consequence of the slight acidity of the soil.

This study aimed to evaluate the dynamics and environmental risk of pesticides in a hydro-agricultural area with intensive agricultural practices, in the Mediterranean region (South of Portugal). Seasonality and location influenced pesticide numbers and concentrations, with the highest levels observed during the dry season. Triazines, phenylureas, and organophosphates were the predominant pesticide classes, with terbuthylazine, bentazone, terbutryn, diazinon, and metolachlor exhibiting the highest detection frequencies (68 % to 72 %). Notably, 44 % of the quantified pesticides are no longer authorized in Portugal, with 33 % posing a high environmental risk. Some insecticides, including imidacloprid, methiocarb, and malathion, were occasionally detected at concentrations that posed high risks to the aquatic ecosystem (RQ ≥ 1). Irgarol, an algicide used in irrigation canals, presented a high risk in 91 % of the analysed samples. The study's distribution profile of pesticides revealed a significant transportation of these compounds from reservoirs to irrigation hydrants, establishing them as a secondary source of crop and environmental contamination. Additionally, the assessment of spatial distribution and environmental risk allowed for the identification of specific pollutants in different locations, prioritizing them based on their ecotoxicological risk to aquatic ecosystems. These findings reinforce the importance of implementing management measures at the level of hydro-agricultural areas, helping to stop the cycle of pesticide contamination. Only this type of strategy will make it possible to protect water quality, biodiversity and the health of citizens, contributing to the European Union's objectives of improving the condition of freshwater bodies and promoting the sustainable use of pesticides.","Environmental risk assessment ; Guadiana Basin ; Hydro-agricultural system ; Pesticide contamination cycle ; Water pollution",3,"Artigos em revista",170304,"Tecnologias CAplicadas",Scopus,"FCT (202304004) Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia","CSIC - Instituto de Diagnostico Ambiental y Estudios del Agua (IDAEA) (Barcelona, Spain); University of Évora (Evora, Portugal); Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia da Universidade Nova de Lisboa (Caparica, Portugal); Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal); Centro Operativo e de Tecnologia de Regadio (Beja, Portugal)",N/A,N/A,"Júnia Alves-Ferreira; Manuel García Vara; Adriana Catarino; Inês Martins; Clarisse Mourinha; Marta Fabião; Maria João Costa; Maria Vittoria Barbieri; M.

Four water bodies of streams in the Guadiana Basin (Álamos, Amieira, Lucefécit, Zebro) were studied in 2017 and 2018 and classified based on the Water Framework Directive (WFD) parameters: Biological Quality Element – Phytobenthos (diatoms), General chemical and physicochemical elements, Specific pollutants, and Priority Substances. Complementarily, bioassays (including lethal and sublethal parameters) were carried out with organisms of different trophic levels: (i) the bacteria Aliivibrio fischeri; (ii) the microalgae Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata; (iii) the crustaceans Daphnia magna, Thamnocephalus platyurus and Heterocypris incongruens. A classification system with 5 scores was developed, permitting to classify water bodies from non-toxic (EC50 > 100 %; growth and feeding rate > 80 %; blue) to highly toxic (EC50 < 10 %; growth and feeding rate < 10 %; red). The comparison between the classification based on the WFD parameters and on ecotoxicological endpoints showed similar results for 71 % of the samples, and significant positive Pearson correlations were detected between the diatom-based Specific Polluosensitivity Index (SPI) and EC50V.fisheri, the algae growth rate and Shannon diversity index. These results indicate that when the biological quality elements cannot be used (namely under drought or flooding conditions) the application of ecotoxicological bioassays may be a good alternative. Further, when ecotoxicological parameters were included, an increase of worse classifications (Bad and Poor) was observed, revealing an improvement in the sensitivity of the classification, mainly in presence of specific and priority substances. So, the ecotoxicological analysis appears to provide useful information regarding the potential presence of both known and unknown contaminants at concentrations that cause biological effects (even within the WFD limits), in agreement with several authors that have already suggested its use in biomonitoring.","Bioassays ; Biotic indices ; Diatoms ; Ecotoxicological classification system ; Specific pollution sensitivity index",5,"Artigos em revista",166392,"Tecnologias CAplicadas",Scopus,"APA (UIDB/04683/2020) Agência Portuguesa do Ambiente","University of Évora (Evora, Portugal); Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia da Universidade Nova de Lisboa (Caparica, Portugal); Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal)",N/A,N/A,"M.

The samples were not toxic to Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, with a growth inhibition rate of less than 10%. The low lethal and sublethal effects may be ascribed to the high nutrient concentration (e.g., 1.76 mg P L−1 and 98.9 mg NO3− L−1, in July) that could have masked toxic effects.

A total of 70 sampling sites were surveyed at Aljustrel and Lousal, in areas already rehabilitated, and at São Domingos, where rehabilitation was only beginning. The soils at São Domingos were very heterogeneous, with extreme values for some properties (e.g., minimum soil pH 2.0 and maximum As concentration, 4382.8 mg kg−1 dry weight basis (DW)). Aljustrel was the site that presented soils with a higher total As, Cu, Pb, and Zn concentration (median values: 441.5, 545.9, 1396.8, and 316.5 mg kg−1 DW, respectively), above the soil quality guidelines values proposed by the Portuguese Environmental Agency (18, 230, 120, and 340 mg kg−1 DW, respectively). A principal component analysis identified the most relevant soil properties to explain the data variance, which were the soil pH and Pb total concentration, followed by Cu and Zn total concentrations, allowing a separation of Aljustrel from the other mines. Pearson correlation coefficients revealed very strong associations between Pb and As, markedly found at higher concentrations in São Domingos, whereas Aljustrel had an elevated concentration of As and Pb, but also of Cu and Zn. It is evident the risk that persists in the Aljustrel mine area, which was not alleviated by the “dig, dump, and cover” techniques that were implemented to rehabilitate the area.","mining activities ; potentially toxic elements ; principal component analysis ; soil pollution ; soil quality guidelines values",9,"Artigos em revista",105,"Tecnologias CAplicadas",Scopus,"FCT (POCI-01-0145-FEDER-007690) Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia","Linking Landscape, Environment, Agriculture And Food (Lisbon, Portugal); University of Évora (Evora, Portugal); Universidade de Aveiro (Aveiro, Portugal); Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal)",N/A,N/A,"Paula Alvarenga; Clarisse Mourinha; Patrícia Palma; Nuno Cruz; Sónia Morais Rodrigues","0000-0002-3225-3358; N/A; 0000-0002-9719-079X; 0000-0002-3969-0972",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

The impact has been felt for years in the rivers and streams receiving AMD from the Aljustrel mine (SW sector of the IPB, Portugal), such as at the Água Forte stream, a tributary of the Roxo stream (Sado and Mira Hydrographic Region). To evaluate the extent of that environmental impact prior to the remediation actions, surface water, sediments, and the macrophyte Scirpus holoschoenus L. were sampled at the Água Forte and the Roxo streams, upstream and downstream from the confluence. The surface water and the sediments were extremely acidic at the Água Forte stream (pH ranges 2.22–2.92 for the water and 2.57–3.32 for the sediment), with high As, Cu, Pb, and Zn concentrations of 2.1, 120, 0.21, and 421 mg kg−1, respectively, in the water, and 661, 1746, 539, and 1994 mg kg−1, respectively, in the sediment, in the location closer to the mine.

The impact of the AMD was also evident in the sediments of the Roxo stream, but not so marked in the water, with circa neutral pH and lower As, Cu, Pb, and Zn concentrations.

The present study analyses the physicochemical and phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll-a) dynamics of a large reservoir, in the Mediterranean region (Alqueva reservoir, Southern Portugal), under diverse meteorological conditions and land cover/land use real scenarios (2017 and 2018). The most important stressors were identified and the necessary tools and information for a more effective management plan were provided. Changes in these parameters were further related to the observed variations in the meteorological conditions and in the land cover/land use. The increase in nutrients and ions in the water column, and of potentially toxic metals in the sediment, were more obvious in periods of severe drought. Further, the enhancement of nutrients concentrations, potentially caused by the intensification of agricultural activities, may indicate an increased risk of water eutrophication.

Water samples were collected bimonthly during 2017 (classified as a drought year) and 2018 (post-drought year) in: Zebro, Álamos and Amieira (intermittent hydrological streams), and Lucefécit (perennial hydrological stream). The pharmaceuticals quantified in higher concentrations, out of 27 investigated, were diclofenac (up to 4806 ng L−1), ibuprofen (3161 ng L−1), hydrochlorothiazide (2726 ng L−1) and carbamazepine (3223 ng L−1). Zebro and Álamos presented the highest contamination by this group of environmental hazardous substances, which may be correlated with the presence of wastewater treatment plants upstream the sampling point of each stream.

Application doses of both mixtures were 2.5, 5.0 and 10% (w/w, dw). These materials corrected soil acidity to circumneutral values and increased extractable P and K concentrations.

The soil was already heavily contaminated with Cu, Pb and Zn and the application of amendments did not increase their pseudo-total concentrations. The CaCl2 extractable fractions of both Cu and Zn decreased to very low values. The improvement in soil quality, compared to fertilizer only treatment, was further evidenced by the increase in some soil enzymatic activities (dehydrogenase, β-glucosidase and cellulase), with a better response for the granules with the higher proportion of biological sludge, as well as by the decrease in the soil-water extract toxicity towards different organisms (Daphnia magna, Thamnocephalus platyurus, and Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata).

However, the potential contaminant loads of such wastes, can be a source of environmental concern. Consequently, legislation has been developed to regulate the use of these wastes in agricultural soils. However, the regulations only consider chemical parameters, which are insufficient to establish the level of environmental risk. A possible solution is the use of species sensitivity distributions (SSDs), employing ecotoxicological data from test batteries that could be incorporated into legislation. In the present study, 2 different hazardous concentrations affecting 5 and 50% of the soil community (HC5 and HC50, respectively) were determined using ecotoxicological data (effect concentrations, 10 and 50% [EC10 and EC50, respectively]) for 5 different wastes. The results demonstrate that, as expected, current legislative thresholds do not translate to environmental risk/protection and that SSDs may be an important tool allowing the simple inclusion and interpretation of ecotoxicological data from test batteries in legislation. On the other hand, SSDs must be used with caution because there are still doubts about their actual value in risk prediction and about which estimates provide adequate protection. For instance, the use of HC50EC10 values is not recommended; these values overlap with the more conservative HC5EC50 data, highlighting the fact that the use of lower effect concentrations may not always provide the most protective approach. Also, hazardous concentrations need to be calibrated at the field or semifield level, to verify environmental protection in different soils/environments and the adequacy of standard test organisms.

The DWTR had neutral characteristics (pH 6.7) and an organic matter (OM) content of 575 g kg−1 dry matter (DM), which makes them a potential amendment for the remediation of mine degraded soils, as they may correct soil acidity and reduce the extractable metal fraction. An incubation assay, with soil and DWTR, with or without lime, was carried out to test the doses to be used in the assisted-phytostabilization experiment. Based on the results obtained, the doses of DWTR used were the equivalent to 48, 96, and 144 t DM ha−1, with and without lime application (CaCO3 11 t DM ha−1). Agrostis tenuis Sibth was used as the test plant. Some amendments doses were able to improve soil characteristics (pH and OM content), to decrease metal extractability by 0.01 M CaCl2 (especially for Cu and Zn), and to allow plant growth, that did not occur in the non-amended soil. Copper, Pb and Zn concentrations in the plant material were lower than the maximum tolerable level for cattle feed, used as an indicator of risk of entry of those metals into the human food chain. The simultaneous application of DWTR (96 and 144 t ha−1), with lime, allowed a reduction in the mine soil ecotoxicity, as evaluated by some lethal and sub-lethal bioassays, including luminescence inhibition of Vibrio fischeri, Daphnia magna acute immobilization test, mortality of Thamnocephalus platyurus, and 72-h growth inhibition of the green microalgae Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata.

The water chemical characterization showed high levels of organic matter and nutrients, mainly in the dry period ((biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5): 18.5–25.5 mg L−1, chemical oxygen demand (COD): 60.8–193.7 mg L−1; total phosphorus (TP): 0.17–0.33 mg L−1)), which may compromise the support of biological life. In accordance with the physicochemical results, the stream had an ecological status less than good. Of the 25 pesticides analysed, only five, namely terbuthylazine, 2-methyl-chlorophenoxyacetic acid, bentazone, mecoprop and metolachlor were quantified. In general, the concentrations of pesticides detected were low, except at the source of the stream in January 2012 (sum of pesticides 2.29 μg L−1), mainly due to the concentration of bentazone (1.77 μg L−1), both values surpassing the European Commission threshold values. The analysis of benthic macroinvertebrates showed low levels of abundance and family diversity, with communities dominated by resistant groups to organic pollution and pesticides, such as the Chironomidae family. In general, the reproduction ecotoxicological results showed a very marked decrease in the number of juveniles per female. The Spearman correlation identified pesticides, namely MCPA (R = −0.89; p < 0.05), as the main responsible for the observed effect. The results showed the linearity and complementarity of the two groups of biological responses, allowing to cover the interactions between the ecosystem's species and the different types of pollutants.","Benthic macroinvertebrates ; Ecotoxicological endpoints ; Pesticides ; Temporary stream",18,"Artigos em revista",,"Tecnologias CAplicadas",Scopus,"FP7 (603437) Seventh Framework Programme","Linking Landscape, Environment, Agriculture And Food (Lisbon, Portugal); CSIC - Instituto de Diagnostico Ambiental y Estudios del Agua (IDAEA) (Barcelona, Spain); University of Évora (Evora, Portugal); Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal); Universitat de Girona (Girona, Spain)",N/A,N/A,"P.

The ecotoxicological efficiency was assessed through the use of lethal and sublethal assays with species Vibrio fischeri and Daphnia magna. Results demonstrated that the AOzPs presented an efficiency of carbamazepine removal higher than 99% (carbamazepine < 2 μg/L) after 12 min of treatment. Relatively to ecotoxicological evaluation, application of acute assay to V. fischeri and chronic assay to D. magna allowed us to highlight that these technologies may form some transformation products that induce toxicity in the bacteria and the crustacean, once these organisms exposed to the undiluted solutions (100%) showed a decrease in the bioluminescence (vibrio) and end up dying before and during the first reproduction (daphnia). Despite that, when the chronic results obtained with the diluted solutions (50 and 25%; important to assess a more realistic scenario considering the dilution factor at the environment) were analyzed, no mortality at the mothers was observed. Compared to a carbamazepine solution (200 μg/L), diluted solutions improved of the reproduction parameters, and no toxic effects in the juvenoid system and in the embryonic development were observed. Relatively to the ecdysteroid effect of a carbamazepine solution (200 μg/L), only the photocatalytic ozonation treatment was able to remove the action of the drug. These results highlight the importance of complementing chemical analysis with ecotoxicological bioassays to assess the best technology to improve the surface water and effluent quality.","Advanced ozonation processes ; Carbamazepine ; Daphnia magna ; Toxicity ; Vibrio fischeri",11,"Artigos em revista",,"Tecnologias CAplicadas",Scopus,"MECD (CAS15-00049) Ministerio de Educación, Cultura y Deporte","Universidad de Extremadura (Badajoz, Spain); Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal); Centro de Investigacao Marinha e Ambiental (Faro, Portugal)",N/A,N/A,"Ana Lourdes Oropesa; Fernando Juan Beltrán; António Miguel Floro; Juan José Pérez Sagasti; Patrícia Palma","0000-0003-4737-5371; N/A; 0000-0002-9719-079X",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

This fact presents a concern for possible effects in the aquatic ecosystems. The objective of this study was to assess the potential lethal and sublethal toxicity of nicotine in aquatic organisms from different trophic levels (Vibrio fischeri, Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, Thamnocephalus platyurus, and Daphnia magna). The bioassays were performed by exposing the organisms to concentrations of nicotine in a range of 0.5–1000 μg/L. Results showed that nicotine, at tested concentration, was not acutely toxic to V. fischeri and T. platyurus. On the contrary, this substance exhibited toxicity to P. subcapitata and Daphnia magna. Thus, concentrations of nicotine of 100 and 200 μg/L promoted an inhibition in the growth of P. subcapitata. In addition, a concentration of 100 μg/L nicotine acted on the reproduction of the crustacean D. magna, by decreasing the number of juveniles produced by female. On the other hand, the results showed that concentrations equal to or greater than 10 μg/L induced the production of daphnids male offspring, which may indicate that nicotine is a weak juvenoid compound of the D. magna endocrine system. Furthermore, the result showed that concentrations tested of this chemical have the capacity to revert the effect of fenoxycarb, a strong juvenoid chemical insecticide. The results of the study revealed that nicotine can induce several changes in some of the most important key groups of the aquatic compartment, which can compromise, in a short time, the balance of aquatic ecosystem. Finally, a preliminary environmental risk assessment of this stimulant was performed from the highest measured concentration in surface water and the no observable effect concentration value in the most sensitive species, i.e., D. magna. This process revealed that nicotine can produce an important risk to aquatic organisms.","Aquatic organisms ; Emerging contaminants ; Environmental risk assessment ; Nicotine ; Standard toxicity tests",43,"Artigos em revista",,"Tecnologias CAplicadas",Scopus,"MECD (CAS15-00049) Ministerio de Educación, Cultura y Deporte","Universidad de Extremadura (Badajoz, Spain); Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal); Centro de Investigacao Marinha e Ambiental (Faro, Portugal)",N/A,N/A,"Ana Lourdes Oropesa; António Miguel Floro; Patrícia Palma","N/A; 0000-0002-9719-079X",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

The amendments were applied for two consecutive years: 6, 12 and 24 t dry matter ha−1 for SS, and the amendment doses for MMSWC and AWC were calculated to deliver the same amount of organic matter (OM) per unit area. The amendments had significant beneficial effects on some soil properties (e.g. soil OM, NKjeldahl, extractable P and K), and on plant productivity parameters (e.g. biomass yield, chlorophyll, foliar area). For instance, soil OM increased from 0.78% to 1.71, 2.48 and 2.51%, after two consecutive years of application of 24 t dry matter ha−1 of SS, MMSWC and AWC, respectively, while the plant biomass obtained increased from 7.75 t ha−1 to 152.41, 78.14 and 29.26 t ha−1, for the same amendments. On the plant, effects were more pronounced for SS than for both compost applications, a consequence of its higher capacity to provide N to the plant in a readily available form. However, after two years of application, the effects on soil properties were more noticeable for both composts, as their OM is more resistant to mineralization, which endures their beneficial effects on soil. Cadmium, Cr, Ni and Pb pseudo-total concentrations, were not affected significantly by the application of the organic wastes to soil, in all tested doses, neither their extractability by 0.01 M CaCl2. On the contrary, Cu and Zn pseudo-total concentrations increased significantly in the second year of the experiment, following the application of the higher rate of MMSWC and AWC, although their extractability remained very low (<0.5% of their pseudo-total fraction). Trace elements concentrations in the aboveground plant material were lower than their maximum tolerable levels for cattle, used as an indicator of risk of their entry into the human food chain. Despite these results, it is interesting to note that the SS promoted a significant increase in the foliar concentrations of Cu, Ni and Zn that did not happen in composts application, which can be explained by the reduction of the soil pH, as a consequence of SS degradation in soil. Concluding, if this type of organic wastes were to be used in a single application, the rate could be as high as 12 or even 24 t ha−1, however, if they are to be applied in an annual basis, the application rates should be lowered to assure their safe application (e.g. to 6 t ha−1). Moreover, it is advisable to use more stable and mature organic wastes, which have longer lasting positive effects on soil characteristics.","Compost ; Field experiment ; Recycling ; Sewage sludge ; Soil organic amendment ; Trace elements",81,"Artigos em revista",,"Tecnologias CAplicadas",Ambas,"FCT (FCOMP-01-0124-FEDER-019330) Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia","Linking Landscape, Environment, Agriculture And Food (Lisbon, Portugal); University of Coimbra, Centre for Functional Ecology (Coimbra, Portugal); Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia da Universidade Nova de Lisboa (Caparica, Portugal); Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal); Centro de Investigacao Marinha e Ambiental (Faro, Portugal)",N/A,N/A,"P.

Results obtained demonstrated that contaminant concentrations required by current legislation might not be a protective measure for the soil ecosystem, as they do not properly translate the potential toxicity of wastes to soil invertebrates. Some wastes with contaminant loadings below thresholds showed higher toxicity than wastes with contaminants concentrations above legal limits. Also, test organism reproduction was differently sensitive to the selected wastes, which highlights the need to account for different organism sensitivities and routes of exposure when evaluating the toxicity of such complex mixtures.

The efficiency of using this technology was assessed by: (i) the study of water permeability and rejection of some chemical parameters, such as total nitrogen, total phosphorus, chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), feacal coliforms, nitrates, chlorides, iron and manganese; and (ii) the evaluation of their ecotoxicological effects, through the use of representative species of different taxonomic and functional groups (Vibrio fischeri, Thamnocephalus platyurus, Daphnia magna, and Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata). Results indicated that all three membranes have high rejection percentages for the majority of the studied parameters (> 90%). All parameters concentrations in the permeate stream were below the limit values from Portuguese legislation and European Directives. With respect to the ecotoxicological effects, in general, the use of membranes removed the toxicity detected in the initial samples (which exhibited significant toxicity). The SW30 membrane showed a greater efficiency for toxicity removal, comparing with the nanofiltration membranes. Further, among the nanofiltration membranes used, the NF90 promoted a greater decrease in the toxicity of the samples. Thus, treatment with the membranes NF90 and SW30 allowed obtaining waters with high quality and low ecotoxicological potential, without risks for human populations and endangering the environmental balance.","Ecotoxicological assess ; Nanofiltration ; Reverse osmosis ; Sublethal endpoints ; Water quality",23,"Artigos em revista",,"Tecnologias CAplicadas",Scopus,N/A,"Linking Landscape, Environment, Agriculture And Food (Lisbon, Portugal); Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia da Universidade Nova de Lisboa (Caparica, Portugal); Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal); Centro de Investigacao Marinha e Ambiental (Faro, Portugal); EMAS (Beja, Portugal)",N/A,N/A,"P.

For this purpose, SS from two different wastewater treatment plants (SS1 and SS2), and a compost produced from SS and agricultural wastes (AWSSC), were characterized for their total metal concentrations, organic contaminants and indicator pathogens, and used in a pot experiment with three application rates, 6, 12 and 24 ton dry matter/ha, cultivated with a hybrid variety of sorghum and Sudan grass (Sorghum bicolor × Sorghum sudanense var.

Both dewatered SS had a marked beneficial effect on plant production and on soil nutritional characteristics, more pronounced than in the case of AWSSC application, without a significant increase in total and in mobile metals concentration in soils. Bioaccumulation factors for metals in plants were low, and their concentrations in the aboveground plant material were lower than the maximum tolerable level for cattle, used as a risk indicator of metal entry into the human food chain.

Chronic exposure to CBZ significantly decreased the reproductive output and the number of molts of D. magna at 200 μg/L. This compound induced the production of male offspring (12 ± 1.7 %), in a non-concentration-dependent manner, acting as a weak juvenile hormone analog. Results showed that this substance, at tested concentrations, did not antagonize the juvenoid action of FEN. Further, CBZ has shown to be toxic to daphnid embryos through maternal exposure interfering with their normal gastrulation and organogenesis stages but not producing direct embryo toxicity. These findings suggest that CBZ could act as an endocrine disruptor in D. magna as it decreases the reproductive output, interferes with sex determination, and causes development abnormality in offspring.

Some organic wastes' eluates promoted high toxic responses, but that toxicity could not be predicted by their chemical characterization, which is compulsory by regulatory documents. In fact, when organisms were exposed to the water-extractable chemical compounds of the organic wastes, the toxic responses were more connected to the degree of stabilization of the organic wastes, or to the treatment used to achieve that stabilization, than to their contaminant load. That is why the environmental risk assessment of the use of organic wastes as soil amendments should integrate bioassays with eluates, in order to correctly evaluate the effects of the most bioavailable fraction of all the chemical compounds, which can be difficult to predict from the characterization required in regulatory documents.

The ecotoxicological assessment showed that sublethal endpoints (e.g., luminescence, growth or reproduction), would be more useful and sensitive to identify toxicity patterns in this type of water body. In general, the results from this ecotoxicological toolbox agreed with the potential ecological status established according to the WFD, which indicates that the bioassays complement the ecological assessment. Furthermore, the use of an ecotoxicological approach can be extremely useful, especially in cases where the biotic indices are difficult to establish, such as in man-made reservoirs.

All the sludges, municipal or other, comply with the requirements of the legislation regarding the possibility of their application to agricultural soil (with the exception of SS2, due to its pathogenic microorganisms content), with a content of organic matter and nutrients that make them interesting to be applied to soil. The composts presented, in general, some constraints regarding their application to soil, and their impairment was due to the existence of heavy metal concentrations exceeding the proposed limit of the draft European legislation. As a consequence, with the exception of AWSSC, most compost samples were not able to meet these quality criteria, which are more conservative for compost than for sewage sludge. From the results, the composting of sewage sludge is recommended as a way to turn a less stabilized waste into a material that is no longer classified as a waste and, judging by the results of this work, with lower heavy metal content than the other composted materials, and without sanitation problems.","Compost ; Heavy metals ; Organic contaminants ; Organic waste ; Pathogenic microorganisms ; Sewage sludge",355,"Artigos em revista",,"Tecnologias CAplicadas",Scopus,"FCT (PEst-OE/AGR/UI0528/2014) Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia","Linking Landscape, Environment, Agriculture And Food (Lisbon, Portugal); Instituto Superior de Agronomia, Universidade de Lisboa (Lisbon, Portugal); Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal); Centro de Investigacao Marinha e Ambiental (Faro, Portugal)",N/A,N/A,"Paula Alvarenga; Clarisse Mourinha; Márcia Farto; Teresa Santos; Patrícia Palma; Joana Sengo; Marie Christine Morais; Cristina Cunha-Queda","N/A; 0000-0002-9719-079X",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

For this purpose, the occurrence of 22 pesticides and some of their degradation products was determined in surficial sediments of the Alqueva reservoir. To assess the potential risk on ecosystem, the measured concentrations of pesticides were compared with regulatory and toxicological benchmarks. Of the 22 pesticides analysed, only 8 were detected.

The sediments most polluted by pesticides were from Lucefécit, constituted totally by fine particles (<0.063 mm) and with high values of organic matter, and are located nearby large agricultural fields. The risk assessment allowed us to conclude that the sediments from the Alqueva reservoir presented low risk, concerning to pesticides, for the various communities that integrate the aquatic ecosystems.

It is located in the Guadiana River Basin, in a semi-arid region with high levels of water scarcity and where agriculture is one of the main activities. The evaluation of sediments comprised: (1) physical and chemical analysis (grain size, pH, organic matter, nitrogen, phosphorus); (2) potentially toxic trace elements (Cu, As, Pb, Cr, Cd, Zn and Ni); and (3) ecotoxicological evaluation with Vibrio fischeri, Thamnocephalus platyurus, Daphnia magna, and Heterocypris incongruens.

Water and sediment samples were collected between 2011 and 2012, at five sampling stations, and analyzed for: (i) water - pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, electrical conductivity, chloride, total phosphorus, total nitrogen, ammonium, nitrate, nitrite, biochemical and chemical oxygen demand, total Fe, Mn, and As; and (ii) sediments - pH, electrical conductivity, organic matter, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, major and trace elements. The results from the water column showed that the organic descriptors exceeded the Portuguese guideline values for water quality for multiple uses at most of the sampling stations. As for nutrients, Ajuda is the station where the concentrations of the total nitrogen and total phosphorus exceeded the guideline values in most months. Ammonium achieved concentrations above the allowed, during the study, in all locations. Trace elements were more abundant in the sediments, surpassing the maximum levels for the protection of aquatic life for As, Cd and Pb, at Alcarrache, Lucefécit and Álamos, respectively. The use of multivariate analysis showed that the major parameters that explained the water quality variability were the nutrients in the water column, and trace elements in the sediments. Comparing the results from this study with results obtained since 2006, we can observe an obvious increment of the organic descriptors and nutrients in the water body. Further, several parameters and observations indicate an increase of the eutrophication process.

Pollution can impair environmental and human health status, and to assure water quality and ecological balance, it is crucial to frequently monitor water supplies. In this study, we used an ecotoxicological test battery to identify the potential toxicity of water from this reservoir. Materials and methods: Water samples from the Alqueva aquatic system were collected bimonthly in 2006 from 11 different water points within the reservoir. Several bioassays were carried out: a 72-h growth test with Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, a 6-day growth test with Chironomus riparius larvae, and the luminescence inhibition test with Vibrio fischeri (Microtox®). Results and discussion: Algae growth was significantly inhibited in several sampling points and periods throughout the year, mainly due to the presence of pesticides. Although in some sampling points pesticide concentrations (single and sum) were still below the maximum permissible concentrations, water samples showed high toxicities to algae, especially during the summer months. In addition, several sampling points showed pesticide concentrations above the permissible level which can pose a significant risk to humans and the environment. Chironomids showed less sensitivity to the water samples, possibly due to the low concentrations of insecticides present. V. fischeri showed no sensitivity when exposed to all the water samples collected throughout the year of 2006. Conclusions: Standardized laboratory bioassays can be useful tools to assess water quality from aquatic systems and can valuably complement chemical analysis evaluation. The results obtained in this study demonstrated that the most sensitive species used in this test battery was the microalgae P. subcapitata. The growth of C. riparius was less affected, which is probably due to the fact that low insecticide concentrations were measured and, furthermore, since this species lives in the sediment and not in the water column and is, therefore, usually more resistant to pollutants. Recommendations and perspectives: On its own, chemical analysis is not enough to derive conclusions on the water quality and/or status, which can be valuably complemented by laboratory bioassays. Single chemical, maximum permissible values, and the sum of pesticide concentrations do not take into account possible patterns of synergism, antagonism, dose level dependencies, or even the dominance of several chemicals within a mixture. In addition, several species from different levels in trophic chains are recommended due to differences in species' sensitivities to chemical compounds that are present. © Springer-Verlag 2009.","Algae ; Biomonitorization ; Chironomidae ; Metallic elements ; Microtox ; Pesticides",42,"Artigos em revista",,"Tecnologias CAplicadas",Scopus,"FCT (GG/GGP/ ME621-0167/05) Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia","Universidade de Coimbra, Faculdade de Farmácia (Coimbra, Portugal); Universidade de Aveiro (Aveiro, Portugal); Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal)",N/A,N/A,"Joanne Rodríguez Pérez; Susana Loureiro; S.

The water quality assessment is very important for implementation of the monitoring and remediation programs to minimize the risk promoted by hazardous substances in aquatic ecosystems. Evaluation of the degree of contamination of aquatic environments must not take in account only its chemical characterization but it must be complemented with biological assays, which determine potential toxic effects and allows an integrated evaluation of its effects in populations and aquatic ecosystem communities. The application of this type of strategy has clear advantages allowing a general evaluation of the effects from all the water components, including those due to unknown substances and synergic, antagonistic, or additive effects. There are only a few studies that reported ecotoxicological acute end points, for the assessment of surface water quality, and the relationship among toxicity results and the anthropogenic pollution sources and the seasonal period. The aim of this study was to assess the ecotoxicological characterization of the surface water from Alqueva reservoir (South of Portugal) and to evaluate the influence of anthropogenic sources of pollution and their seasonal variation in its toxicity. The construction of Alqueva reservoir was recently finished (2002) and, to our knowledge, an ecotoxicological assessment of its surface water has not been performed. Because of that, no information is available on the possible impact of pollutants on the biota. The surface water toxicity was assessed using acute and chronic bioassays. The results are to be used for developing a monitoring program, including biological methods. Materials and methods: Water samples were collected during 2006-2007, at each of the nine sampling sites selected in Alqueva reservoir. These sampling points allow an assessment at the upstream (Sra. Ajuda, Alcarrache, Álamos-Captação), at the middle (Alqueva-Montante, Alqueva-Mourão, Lucefecit), and at the downstream of the water line (Alqueva-Jusante; Ardila-confluência; Moinho das Barcas). The campaigns occurred in February, March, May, July, September, and November of 2006 and February, March, and May of 2007. The rainy season comprised November, February, and March, and the dry season included May, July, and September. A total of 81 samples were collected during the study period. The physical-chemical parameters were analyzed following standard and recommended methods of analysis (APHA et al. 1998). The pesticide analyses were performed using gas chromatography according to DIN EN ISO 6468 (1996). Surface water ecotoxicity was evaluated using the following bioassays: Vibrio fischeri luminescence inhibition, Thamnocephalus platyurus mortality, and Daphnia magna immobilization and reproduction assay. The Spearman rank correlation coefficients were used to evaluate the associations between the water sample physicochemical properties (from each sampling station in each season) and the acute and chronic toxicological effects, with a level of significance p < 0.05. Results: In the acute toxicity study, the species that was found to be the most sensitive was T. platyurus. T. platyurus detected a higher number of toxic water samples during the dry season. Concerning the luminescent inhibition of V. fischeri, the results showed that this organism detected a great number of toxic water samples in rainy seasons. The water samples, which promoted higher toxic effects towards this species, were from the north and from the middle of the reservoir. The correlation analysis showed that V. fischeri luminescent inhibition (%) was positively correlated with total phosphorus, chlorpyrifos, iron, and arsenic. T. platyurus mortality (%) was positively correlated with the water pH, 5-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), chlorides, atrazine, simazine, terbuthylazine, and endosulfan sulfate contents. Although the surface waters did not promote acute toxicity to the crustacean D. magna, in the chronic exposure, a significant decrease in the number of juveniles per female was observed, mainly at the dry period. The number of juveniles per female, in the reproduction test of D. magna, was negatively correlated with pH, temperature, BOD5, chloride, atrazine, simazine, terbuthylazine, and endosulfan sulfate. The water toxicity of the Alqueva water might be due principally to the intensive agriculture activities surrounding the reservoir and to the municipal wastewater discharges. Discussion: The physicochemical parameters and the pesticide concentrations indicated that the water quality was worse in the north part of the reservoir system. These results are characteristic of the majority of reservoirs, once the construction of the dam promoted, by itself, the impounding of water flow and the increase of compound residence time. The toxicity tests corroborate with the chemical characterization. Acute toxicity of Alqueva water may be a result of the effect promoted by chlorpyrifos, endosulfan sulfate, phosphorus, and iron. Chronic toxicity may be a result of the effect of herbicides, arsenic, organic matter, endosulfan sulfate in mixture. Hence, the water toxicity of the Alqueva might be due principally to the intensive agriculture activities surrounding the reservoir and to the municipal wastewater discharges. Conclusions: This study has shown that a large number of samples from different sites of the Alqueva reservoir contained potentially toxic contaminants. The sites with impaired water quality were those located at the north of the reservoir and in the surrounding areas of intensive agricultural activity. The results demonstrated that the use of a screening of acute and chronic toxicity tests with organisms from different trophic levels and with distinct sensibilities allowed the detections of several patterns of toxicity from spatial and temporal variability promoted by natural or anthropogenic sources. The chronic responses showed, especially in the dry season, that some of the species belonging to this aquatic ecosystem might be at risk. Recommendations and perspectives: The V. fischeri and T. platyurus are two species that should be used in the acute bioassays for the ecotoxicological monitoring programs of this reservoir. It is recommended that other species, such as a productive organism (algae), be included in the next study, once the water reservoir had high levels of herbicides. Ecotoxicological assessment of surface water must integrate initial screening based on acute tests followed always by chronic bioassays. The results implicitly suggest that the implementation of processes of remediation by reducing pollutant input into the reservoir and by the implementation of water treatment processes is important and necessary. © Springer-Verlag 2009.","Acute toxicity ; Alqueva reservoir ; Chronic toxicity ; Daphnia magna ; Pesticides ; Surface water toxicity ; Thamnocephalus platyurus ; Trace metals ; Vibrio fischeri",66,"Artigos em revista",,"Tecnologias CAplicadas",Scopus,"FEDER  European Regional Development Fund","Universidade de Coimbra, Faculdade de Farmácia (Coimbra, Portugal); Universidade de Aveiro (Aveiro, Portugal); Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal)",N/A,N/A,"Patrícia Palma; Paula Alvarenga; Vera Palma; Cláudia Matos; Rosa Maria Fernandes; Amadeu Soares; Isabel Rita Barbosa","N/A; 0000-0002-9719-079X",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

The featured endpoints were the number of offspring per female and abnormalities of both offspring and embryos. Chlorpyrifos exhibited significant toxic effects on the embryonic development manifested in the appearance of abnormalities, including arrested eggs, in 20% of the embryos exposed to a concentration of 0.01 μg L-1. Furthermore, chronic exposition to the insecticide yielded a proportion of offspring abnormalities in later stages of development of about 43% at 0.01 μg L-1. In contrast, a significant reduction in the number of offspring produced per female was only observed above a concentration of 0.03 μg L-1.

We studied the effects of the treatments on soil phytotoxicity and enzymatic activities, and on the composition and toxicity of the soil leachate towards Vibrio fischeri and Daphnia magna. Application of SS led to the greatest values of dehydrogenase, acid phosphatase, β-glucosidase, protease and urease activities, corresponding to the greatest overall microbial and biochemical activity in amended soils. Conversely, GWC did not increase these enzymatic activities, relative to the unamended soil, or enhance ryegrass growth. Cellulase activity increased with increasing application rates of the amendments tested, but decreased at the highest SS application rate. The organic amendments were able to suppress soil toxicity to levels that did not affect D. magna, when applied at 50 and 100 Mg ha-1, but SS, at the same application rates, increased the soil leachate toxicity towards V. fischeri. Moreover, ryegrass showed some phytotoxic symptoms when 100 Mg ha-1 of SS were applied. This study showed the importance of an integrated evaluation of soil quality on remediation processes. Although SS immobilized trace metals and corrected soil acidity, improving soil biochemical status, when used at high application rates it led to toxicity of soil leachate towards V. fischeri, decreased soil cellulase activity and impaired ryegrass growth. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the ecdysteroid activity of two pesticides (atrazine and endosulfan sulphate), with distinct modes of action and which act in the juvenoid system of the crustacean Daphnia magna as weak juvenoid compounds. To assess the ecdysteroid activity, we first exposed maternal daphnids and embryos to nominal concentrations of the pesticides and determined the effect promoted by these pesticides on the molting frequency and on abnormalities in the embryos development. Furthermore, we evaluated if the toxic effects observed with the isolated pesticides were promoted or not by the disruption of the ecdysteroids system of the crustacean, by co-administrating of them with 20-hydroxyecdysone hormone. This hormone is the prime form of the invertebrate's ecdysteroids system and it is responsible for the crustacean molting process. Both pesticides induced an increase of embryo abnormalities development. Endosulfan sulphate promoted a delay in the molting process. The effects induced by atrazine were not altered by co-exposure to 20-hydroxyecdysone. In contrast, the co-administration of 20-hydroxyecdysone allowed the reversion of the effects on both the molting process and embryonic development elicited by endosulfan sulphate. These results suggest that atrazine promotes its toxicity without interfering with the ecdysteroid activity of the crustacean.

The SS was applied at 100 and 200 Mg ha-1 (dry weight basis), and the SBS at 7 Mg ha-1. All pots were sown with Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.). After 60 d of growth, shoot biomass was quantified and analysed for Cu, Pb and Zn. The pseudo-total and bioavailable contents of Cu, Pb and Zn and the enzymatic activities of β-glucosidase, acid phosphatase, cellulase, protease and urease were determined in the soil mixtures. Two indirect acute bioassays with leachates from the soil (luminescent inhibition of Vibrio fischeri and Daphnia magna immobilization) were also used. The SS, in particular when in combination with SBS, corrected soil acidity, while increasing the total organic matter content and the cation exchange capacity. The application of SS led to a decrease in the level of effective bioavailable metals (extracted by 0.01 M CaCl2, pH 5.7, without buffer), but caused an increase in their potential bioavailability (extracted by a solution of 0.5 M NH4CH3COO, 0.5 M CH3COOH and 0.01 M EDTA, pH 4.7). Plant biomass increased more than 10 times in the presence of 100 Mg SS ha-1, and more than five times with the combined use of 100 Mg SS ha-1 and SBS, but a considerable phytotoxic effect was observed for the application rate of 200 Mg SS ha-1. Copper, Pb and Zn concentrations in the shoots of L. multiflorum decreased significantly when using 100 Mg SS ha-1 or SBS. The activities of β-glucosidase, urease and protease increased with increasing SS applications rates, but cellulase had a reduced activity when using 200 Mg ha-1 SS. Both amendments were able to suppress soil toxicity to levels that did not affect D. magna, but increased the soil leachate toxicity towards V. fischeri, especially with the application of 200 Mg SS ha-1. This study showed that for this type of mine soils, and when using SS of similar composition, the maximum SS application rate should be 100 Mg ha-1, and that liming the SS amended soil with SBS did not contribute to a further improvement in soil quality. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Official guidelines to assess sewage sludge and compost quality are mostly based on total metal content of these residues. Measurement of the total concentration of metals may be useful as a general index of contamination, but provides inadequate or little information about their bioavailability, mobility or toxicity when the organic residue is applied to the soil. However, ecotoxicity tests provide an integrated measure of bioavailability and detrimental effects of contaminants in the ecosystem. In the present study, three different types of biodegradable organic residues (BORs) have been considered: sewage sludge from municipal wastewater treatment (SS), compost from the organic fraction of unsorted municipal solid waste (MSWC), and garden waste compost (GWC). The BORs were subjected to chemical characterisation and total metal quantification (Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn), in order to verify their suitability for land application. Water leachability was determined through the DIN 38414-S4 method, while the modified BCR sequential extraction procedure was used for metal speciation. Ecotoxicity of the BORs was studied by direct and indirect bioassays. Direct toxicity bioassays were: plant growth tests with cress (Lepidium sativum L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), and earthworm (Eisenia fetida) mortality. On the other hand, indirect exposure bioassays, with leachate from the residues, took into account: luminescent bacteria (Vibrio fischeri), seed germination (L. sativum and H. vulgare) and Daphnia magna immobilization. As far as total metal concentration is concerned, with particular reference to Zn, SS resulted neither suitable for the use in agriculture nor compatible to be disposed of as an inert material into landfill, according to the Directive 1999/31/EC. Zinc in SS was mainly present in exchangeable form (28.5%), appearing as highly bioavailable. As a consequence, SS exhibited either high ecotoxicity effects with the indirect exposure bioassays or significant mortality with the earthworm bioassay. Total content of metals in MSWC allowed its classification as ""stabilised biowaste"", according to 2nd draft [DG Env.A.2. Working document of Biological treatment of biowaste - 2nd draft. Directorate-General Environment, Brussels, 12th February; 2001. accessed in:http://europa.eu.int/comm/environment/waste/facts_en.htm, at 10/09/2002] while leachate, on the basis of the concentration of these contaminants, could be classified as ""inert waste"". This residue showed significant ecotoxicity effects with direct exposure bioassays as well as with the luminescent bacteria bioassay. However, it resulted less toxic than SS. Finally, GWC could be classified as a Class 2 compost, with no detectable toxic effects on the organisms used in the bioassays, except for the luminescent bacteria. In this case, an EC50 of 73.0% was observed. Considering the results, the use of a battery of toxicity test in conjunction with chemical analysis should be suggested, in order to correctly assess possible environmental risks deriving from disposal or land application of biodegradable organic residues. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Among the changes of plasma and cells lipid profile responsible for this prevention is the increase of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA-20:5ω3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA-22:6ω3) levels in cell membrane phospholipids. Provided that haemodialysis patients present a high risk of cardiovascular disease, they constitute a group where the evaluation of the putative beneficial effects of dietary supplementation with ω3 fatty acids supplementation is of interest. A group of 23 haemodialysis patients and a control group of 10 healthy volunteers were submitted to a diet supplemented with Portuguese canned sardine (4.3 g of ω3 fatty acids; 2.1 g EPA and 1.33 g DHA) three times per week during 3 months. The fatty acid profile of erythrocyte phospholids was evaluated at the start and at the end of supplementation period. Before supplementation EPA content was lower in haemodialysis patients (0.56%) than in controls (1.33%) and increased significantly in both groups, respectively, to 1.5% and 2.5%, after the 3-month dietary supplementation. The percentages of DHA and docosapentaenoic acid (DPA-22:5ω3) were similar before supplementation in patients and in controls (1.76 and 1.96%, respectively) but after supplementation only an increase of DPA in the control group (2.67%) was observed. Nevertheless, after supplementation, DPA/EPA and DHA/DPA ratios, used to evaluate the activity of desaturases and elongases enzymes, were similar in both groups suggesting the presence of an active system of these enzymes in both controls and haemodialysis patients. These results could be explained by a permanent deficiency in absorption/incorporation of EPA in haemodialysis patients which can be the cause of the initial low EPA levels in spite of identical regular fish consumption in both groups and further supported by the finding of an only partial correction after supplementation. © 2004 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

Thus, the aim of our study was to analyse the effects of amiodarone on renal function in rats. Experiments were carried out in male Wistar rats divided in two experimental groups: 1) a control group, (n=8), 2) a group that received a daily intraperitoneal injection of amiodarone (50 mg/kg body weight) for 6 days (n=5). At the end of the treatment, renal function was measured by clearance creatinine and acute clearance studies. Renal toxicity was evaluated by urinary N-acetyl-glucosamine and alkaline phosphatase. At the end of the experiment, histology studies were done. Rats treated with amiodarone had a higher serum creatinine (182%) and a lower glomerular filtration rate (53%), renal plasma flow (68%) and filtration fraction (62%) than controls. Rats treated with amiodarone also showed an increase in urinary N-acetyl-glucosamine (221%) and alkaline phosphatase (4.151%) excretion which corresponds with tubular alterations showed on electron microscopy.

It is currently known that ω3 fatty acids play important role in the prevention of several pathologies like the coronary heart disease, hypertension, diabetes and other. The protection played by ω3 fatty acids against coronary heart disease may be related to antiatherogenic effects and/or to the modification of risk factors through mechanisms related to lipid metabolism. The objective of this work was to evaluate, in healthy volunteers, the effect of a diet supplementation with canned sardine, which is rich in ω3 fatty acids on the profile of plasma and erythrocytes, lipids, phospholipids and fatty acids. The serum levels of total cholesterol and high density lipoproteins (HDL) did not change during the period of the supplementation, triacylglycerol levels showed a trend for a decrease and low density lipoproteins (LDL)-derived thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (LDL TBARS) levels showed a decrease. Incorporation of eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic fatty acids (EPA and DHA, respectively) into plasma and erythrocyte phospholipids was observed. The results suggest that the undergone dietary supplementation may have allowed the incorporation of ω3 polyunsaturated fatty acids into cell membranes and has increased the resistance of LDL to oxidative stress.

Water footprint is an indicator that takes account of all the water involved in the creation of a product and may help producers to identify hotspots, and reduce water consumption and the corresponding production costs. In recent years several studies have been reported on wine water footprint determination, but mostly focused on the viticulture phase or assuming no grey water footprint at the winery since it has a treatment system. In the framework of the WineWaterFootprint project a medium-size winery was monitored, with direct measurements, regarding determination of the blue and grey components of water footprint. The determined winery water footprint ranged from 9.6 to 12.7 L of water per wine bottle of 0.75 L, the wastewater produced being responsible for about 98%, which means that the grey component cannot be disregarded. The developed scenarios show that a potential reduction of 87% in winery water footprint can be obtained with almost no investment. The challenge of reducing the grey footprint is not in technology development, but rather in the proper maintenance and monitoring of treatment systems.","Sustainable wine production ; Water efficiency ; Water footprint",18,"Artigos em revista",,Biociências,Scopus,N/A,"Linking Landscape, Environment, Agriculture And Food (Lisbon, Portugal); Instituto Nacional de Investigação Agrária e Veterinária (Lisbon, Portugal); Instituto Politécnico de Bragança (Braganca, Portugal); University of Évora (Evora, Portugal); Institute for Systems and Computer Engineering, Technology and Science (Porto, Portugal); Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal); Politécnico de Santarém (Santarem, Portugal)",N/A,N/A,"A.

The key challenge is developing materials capable of withstanding the harsh environmental conditions and to ensure high reliability in use, particularly in terms of redox kinetics and better activity at low operation temperatures. In this work, we demonstrate that cork-templated ceria can significantly enhance the hydrogen production performance under solar irradiation heating. Three types of ceria morphologies were synthesised and investigated in two-step thermochemical redox cycles, namely ceria granules (ecoceramics) prepared from cork templates based on either a green water-based or an acetone solvent-based approach, as well as ceria foams replicated from polyurethane templates. These materials were cycled in a high-temperature indirectly-irradiated solar tubular reactor, heatedviaconcentrated solar light, using a temperature-swing process. Samples were typically thermally reduced at 1400-1450 °C and subsequently re-oxidised with H2O between 950-1150 °C. The green synthesis ceria granules had up to 25% and 32% higher average H2production yields than the acetone-based ecoceramics and replicated ceria foams, respectively. On average, H2production rates for cork-templated ceria granules (1.3 ± 0.2 mL min−1g−1) were up to ∼60% higher than for ceria foams (0.8 ± 0.3 mL min−1g−1), indicating that the morphology of this three-dimensionally ordered macroporous (3-DOM) CeO2improves the reaction kinetics. This is attributed to the smaller mean cell size of the cork-derived ecoceramic (25 μm) compared to that of the replicated ceria foam (575 μm), suggesting that their semi-closed wall cells enhanced reaction rates. The increase in reduction temperature from 1400 to 1450 °C resulted in the highest H2production rate (1.6 mL min−1g−1) reported so far for 3-DOM ceria. Neither loss in redox performance nor change in grain morphology was observed from the first to the last cycle.

The irrigation area was pedologically and topographically different, showing low to high aptitude to irrigation. It was taken into consideration five soil units which were carefully characterised and it was studied the soil variables responsible for its variation. Particular technical procedures, such as the opening of hollows between rows, were taken into account in order to increase water retention capacity as well as to increase the aptitude to irrigation in the soil. Some yield components and plant roots were also studied. The inherent characteristics of the soil responsible for most pedologic variability were: soil thickness, gravel content, pH, exchangeable cations and texture of the superficial layer. The leaf area and the LAI, were the growth parameters which better explained the variation of corn yield. The soil unit V (a thicker soil, with less content of EG, more clay - montmorillonite type, higher pH and exchangeable cations), was the one presenting higher values of these two parameters, 5181 cm2/ plant and 4.2, respectively. These results were in concordance with the distribution of the root systems at the same phase. As a conclusion we can say that the corn yield was clearly influenced by soil potential productivity and it wasn't significantly modified by irrigation technology.

Background: The World Health Organisation estimates that by 2050, the world’s population over 60 will number two billion people, which poses complex challenges in terms of maintaining the mental health of older adults. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the prevalence of depressive symptoms in this population, but the post-pandemic phase has not yet been studied much. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was carried out in 2023 among institutionalised and non-institutionalised older adults (total n = 525; institutionalised = 458; non-institutionalised = 67) who were selected by convenience sampling. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was used to assess the presence of depressive symptoms, the WHOQOL-BREF to assess perceived quality of life and the Loneliness Scale (UCLA) to assess negative feelings of loneliness. Unconditional logistic regression models were fitted to compute crude adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and the respective 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) for the association between sociodemographic, clinical and psychosocial characteristics and depressive symptomatology, according to institutionalisation status. The final model was adjusted for sex, age, QoL and feelings of loneliness. Results: Of the 525 participants, 74.6% of the non-institutionalised participants had no or minimal depressive symptoms, while 55.4% of the institutionalised participants fell into this category. Mild to moderately severe depressive symptoms were present in 25.4% of the non-institutionalised participants. 26.9% of the institutionalised participants had mild symptoms, 11.8% had moderate symptoms, 3.9% had moderately severe symptoms, and 2.0% had severe depressive symptoms. Overall, a higher quality of life was associated with lower levels of depressive symptoms. Participants describing feelings of loneliness were more likely also to present depressive symptoms (OR = 78.10; 95%CI 2.90–2106.08 and OR = 3.53; 95%CI 1.72–6.91 for non-institutionalised and institutionalised older adults, respectively), independently of institutionalisation status. Conclusions: The prevalence of depressive symptoms is high in older adults, which means that it has not decreased after the increase seen due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A lower perception of quality of life and the presence of negative feelings of loneliness are associated with the presence of depressive symptoms. These conclusions suggest that plans should be developed to intervene in the dimensions of depressive symptoms, perceived quality of life and negative feelings of loneliness.","depression ; depressive symptoms ; loneliness ; older adults ; quality of life",0,"Artigos em revista",,Saúde,Scopus,N/A,"University of Évora (Evora, Portugal); Universitat Rovira i Virgili (Tarragona, Spain); Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal)",N/A,N/A,"Celso Silva; Rogério Ferreira; Bruno Morgado; Elisabete Alves; César Fonseca","0000-0002-4258-8629; 0000-0001-5180-2036; 0000-0002-9931-3677; 0000-0002-7738-0887; 0000-0001-6975-612X",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Goals To debate the contribution of qualitative research in the design of health interventions. Methods This article aims to answer the question: ‘What are the contributions of qualitative research to the design of health interventions? From the literature review, the authors reflect on the importance of qualitative studies to allow the integration of people's needs, experiences and difficulties in areas as complex as self-care, behavioral change or adherence to the therapeutic regime. Results Qualitative research is a contribution to the design of health interventions, supporting not only their development but also their evaluation and implementation, by understanding issues related to knowledge transfer, theorizing mechanisms of action and understanding how the context influences and acceptability of interventions. This statement is a challenge for the use of methods to understand aspects related to people's decision-making (who receives and who implements the intervention), the context, modes of implementation and mechanisms of the intervention and other elements of the interventions that are not so observable and readily measurable, influence health care-sensitive outcomes. The person-centered care approach implies that methods used in the design of interventions are person-centered through qualitative research. Conclusions. Qualitative research plays a key role in understanding the expectations, experiences and behaviors of people targeted by interventions, thus contributing to evidence-based practice.","Health ; Intervention ; Qualitative Research",1,"Artigos em revista",e857,Saúde,Scopus,N/A,"Escola Superior de Enfermagem de Lisboa (Lisbon, Portugal); Nursing Research, Innovation and Development Centre of Lisbon (Lisbon, Portugal); Atlântica Instituto Universitário (Oeiras, Portugal); Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal); Escola de Enfermagem Anna Nery (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil)",N/A,N/A,"Inês Agostinho; Neuza Reis; Luís Sousa; Rogério Ferreira; Marcelle Miranda da Silva; Cristina Lavareda Baixinho","0000-0002-9570-3926; 0000-0002-8126-765X; 0000-0002-9708-5690; 0000-0001-5180-2036; 0000-0003-4872-7252; 0000-0001-7417-1732",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

In critically ill patients, admitted to intensive care units, these lesions often appear associated to the medical devices to which they are connected. The literature review concludes that, sometimes, nursing interventions to prevent these injuries are undervalued hence, associated with the risk factors of critically ill patients, it leads to an increase in the incidence of injuries. The present Scoping Review aimed to answer the research question, formulated according to the PCC acronym: “What are the nursing interventions for the prevention of pressure ulcers associated to medical devices in intensive care units?”. The data search made in the MEDLINE and CINAHL databases, with inclusions criteria, allowed the identification of primary and secondary articles published between 2017 and 2022. The results of this secondary study show the medical devices that are most associated with pressure injuries in intensive care units are the nasogastric tube, the non-invasive ventilation face mask, the urinary catheter, the pulse oximeter, the electrocardiogram monitoring electrodes and venous catheters. Preventive measures include: nursing care in the fixation of medical devices; frequent repositioning of medical devices; protection and padding of body areas in contact with medical devices; replacement of rigid devices with flexible devices, when available; professional attention so that medical devices are not under patients; early assessment and removal of medical devices when clinically possible. It is concluded that as the incidence of this problem is an indicator of the quality and safety of health care, health institutions should implement policies to assess, prevent and treat it. There is a need to think of technological solutions that can reduce the risk and/or achieve the determination of skin changes suggestive of risk of injury.","Intensive Care Unit ; Nursing care ; Pressure ulcer ; Prevention",1,"Artigos em conferência",,Saúde,Scopus,N/A,"Hospital de Vila Franca de Xira (Vila Franca de Xira, Portugal); Escola Superior de Saúde Atlântica (Barcarena, Portugal); Escola Superior de Enfermagem de Lisboa (Lisbon, Portugal); Nursing Research, Innovation and Development Centre of Lisbon (Lisbon, Portugal); University of Évora (Evora, Portugal); Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal); Administração Regional de Saúde de Lisboa e Vale do Tejo (Lisbon, Portugal)",N/A,N/A,"Francisco João; Mariana Silva; Raquel Calhau; Tatiana Bellem; Patricia Nascimento; Luís Sousa; Rogério Ferreira; Óscar Ferreira; Sandy Severino; Cristina Lavareda Baixinho","N/A; 0000-0002-9708-5690; 0000-0001-5180-2036; 0000-0002-1703-347X; 0000-0002-5162-2980; 0000-0001-7417-1732",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Results: Low alphas suggested multidimensionality; the similarity coefficients indicated confounding between two factors but B&W and the Friedman test (p <.001) suggest nurses perceive more quality in outcome than in process. Conclusions: The similarity coefficients are preferable to Cronbach's alpha for estimating internal consistency and for detecting multidimensionality.

Through environmental measurements and student surveys, thermal perceptions, preferences and factors such as position within the classroom were analysed. The results reveal that NV classrooms offer sustainable benefits, but their effectiveness decreases when outside temperatures exceed 28 °C, increasing thermal discomfort. In contrast, AC classrooms maintain more stable and comfortable conditions, although they have thermal gradients that affect specific zones, such as areas near windows or air vents.

Copper ores from small mines and copper artefacts from Chalcolithic settlements were subjected to Pb isotope analysis. Some of Pb isotope ratios obtained in ores from the Ossa-Morena Zone, but also from the South Portuguese Zone, evince the existence of deposits with highly radiogenic Pb, which was previously considered rare in the Iberian Peninsula. Pb isotope ratios of artefacts were compared with Pb isotope fields of closer geological/tectonostratigraphic zones, namely the South Portuguese Zone, Ossa-Morena Zone and Central Iberian Zone. The assessment suggests that most artefacts were produced with copper from the Ossa-Morena Zone. Nevertheless, a flat axe of the Três Moinhos settlement is a remarkable exception due to its highly radiogenic Pb signature, which only has parallels in the Iberian Peninsula on copper ores of the Chalcolithic mines of La Profunda and El Milagro (northern Spain).

This study is highlighted by the need for fitness centers to remain competitive and profitable and the fact that PT services are one of the top ten global fitness trends. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from 412 fitness center customers. Partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was used to test each proposed hypothesis. Findings: Nine of the ten hypotheses tested, between service convenience, service quality, perceived value and behavioral intentions, were supported. The results from bootstrapping supported the indirect effects of service quality and perceived value in the relationship between service convenience, service quality and behavioral intentions. The presence of the PT service affects the majority of the relationships in the model. Research limitations/implications: Customers with PT services may have different expectations and perceptions based on the cost associated with the service. Managers may consider adapting their service strategies to these distinct customer segments, offering differentiated service levels or targeted convenience improvements.

Body image is a predictor of physical, psychological, and social health. Therefore, it can be an indicator for detecting health problems, to be used in the con-text of higher education. The aim of this study was to assess body image satisfaction in higher education students and to determine whether body image dissatisfaction is related to lifestyle behaviours and life satisfaction. Methodology. This study included 166 Portuguese higher education students. Body image was assessed using the Figure Rating Scale. Active choices during every-day life were assessed using the Active Choice Index. The questionnaire also included questions about sleep behaviour and tobacco and alcohol consumption. Satisfaction with Life was assessed using a five-item scale previously adapted for the Portuguese population. Results. There was a predominance of boys dissatisfied with thinness (26.10%), while the majority of girls revealed that they were dissatisfied due to being overweight (55.70%). The results indicate statistically significant differences between boys and girls in terms of body image categories (p<0.001). However, when we analysed the behaviours separately according to gender, there were no differences. Active be-haviours, as well as the other health behaviours analysed (hours of sleep per week and alcohol and tobacco consumption) did not differ between the different levels of body image satisfaction (p>0.05).

The aim of the present study was to analyse the association between the level of Moderate-Vigorous Physical Activity (MVPA) practice in schoolchildren diagnosed with ADHD and mathematical calculation, linguistic reasoning, hyperactive-attentive behaviour and the level of selective attention. Ninety-four students (44 boys; 47% and 50 girls; 53%) aged 9.48 ± 2.10 years participated. Mathematical calculation and linguistic reasoning were assessed by means of ad hoc tests. For hyperactive-attentive behaviour in the classroom the EDAH test was used and attention was measured with the d2 test. The results showed that a higher level of MVPA was associated with a higher level of linguistic reasoning. When analysed by gender, in girls, a higher level of MVPA was associated with higher mathematical calculation and linguistic reasoning, less hyperactive-attentive behaviour and a better level of attention. It is concluded that a high level of weekly MVPA could predict higher mathematical calculation and linguistic reasoning and low presence of hyperactive-impulsive behaviour at school. The results suggest the promotion of MVPA practice in schoolchildren diagnosed with ADHD.","academic performance ; conduct disorder ; inhibition ; physical exercise ; schoolchildren",2,"Artigos em revista",,"Artes H Desporto",Scopus,N/A,"Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal); Universidad de Jaén (Jaen, Spain)",N/A,N/A,"Sara Suárez-Manzano; Jose Luis Solas-Martínez; Vania Loureiro; Alba Rusillo-Magdaleno","N/A; 0000-0003-2458-3004",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

They are faced with greater autonomy of choice but also with greater academic obligations that condition their behaviour. The purpose of this study is to determine which health behaviours differentiate higher education students with moderate to severe depressive symptoms from those with mild to low symptoms. Material and methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 166 Portuguese higher education students (58.4% males). The health behaviours assessed were physical activity and sitting time through the International PA Questionnaire – Short Form (IPAQ-SF), active choices through the Active Choice Index Questionnaire, and sports practice and sleeping time through the National Dietary and Physical Activity Survey. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. The Mann-Whitney test was used to assess gender differences in depressive symptoms. An Odds-Ratio was calculated to establish the probability of being classified with moderate to severe depressive symptoms. Results: 24.1% of students showed moderate to severe depressive symptoms. In an analysis by gender, it was found that girls spend less time sitting on average than boys (p < 0.001). Students with moderate to severe depressive symptoms show on average more sitting time (p = 0.018) and less sleep time during weekdays (p = 0.005). Conclusions: Sitting time and sleep time are health behaviours that are associated with higher depressive symptoms in higher education students. Higher education institutions are considered to play a key role in promoting health behaviours that can interfere with students’ mental health.","depression ; exercise ; sedentary behaviour ; sleep duration ; students",0,"Artigos em revista",,"Artes H Desporto",Scopus,N/A,"Universidade de Lisboa (Lisbon, Portugal); Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal)",N/A,N/A,"Bebiana Sabino; Vânia Loureiro; Sara Pereira; Helena Ferreira-Barbosa","N/A; 0000-0003-2458-3004",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Therefore, the practice of physical activity should be understood as one of the forms of primary and secondary prevention for the reduction of chronic diseases and premature death. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of a physical exercise program on body composition (body mass index (BMI), body fat (BF) and waist circumference (WC), aerobic fitness (VO2max) and muscular fitness (vertical jump, horizontal jump, arm flexion, abdominal strength and flexibility). Being a randomized study, the exercise program was performed in a three-month period, twice a week, in 60-minute sessions. At the beginning of each class there was a playful sport activity to improve aerobic fitness, followed by a second activity with the goal to develop muscular fitness with strength (upper, middle and lower) and flexibility exercises. The physical exercise program was evaluated according to the procedures of the FITEscola platform (Ortega et al., 2011; Plowman, 2013; Welk, Laurson, Eisenmann & Cureton, 2011) and their reference values. Significant results were obtained in the variables of the aerobic fitness (VO2max, p=.006), muscular strength (vertical jump, p=.000; horizontal jump, p=.002), as well at the % BF level (p=.017). Regarding the variables of body composition, we can conclude that the exercise program did not have the expected impact on the BMI and WC, as well for the arm flexion and flexibility variables. Considering the results achieved, we conclude that the physical exercise program had a positive influence on the reduction of the % body fat, improvement of aerobic fitness and variables of muscular fitness (vertical jump, horizontal jump, abdominal strength), reinforcing the importance of developing this type of interventions and the impact they can take on reducing cardiometabolic risk factors.","Body Fat Mass ; Children ; Physical Activity ; Physical Fitness ; School",2,"Artigos em revista",,"Artes H Desporto",Scopus,N/A,"Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal)",N/A,N/A,"V.

However, better levels of speed-agility, strength, and flexibility were not related with improvements in any of the dependent variables analyzed (all p >,05). Cardiorespiratory fitness is the physical fitness component with the highest relation with cognitive abilities in youngsters. We suggest the implementation of specific programs aimed at increasing cardiorespiratory fitness levels through Physical Education, especially employing systematic physical activity practices during the extracurricular period.","Cardiorespiratory fitness ; Cognitive performance ; Divergent thinking ; Physical Education",15,"Artigos em revista",,"Artes H Desporto",Scopus,N/A,"Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal); Universidad de Jaén (Jaen, Spain)",N/A,N/A,"Alberto Mezcua-Hidalgo; Alberto Ruiz-Ariza; Vania A.

Design: Cross-sectional study. Settings: In 20 European countries. Participants: A total of 34 993 (16 749 men, 18 244 women) European adults. Measures: Data were from the 2014 European Social Survey (n = 34 993) on 4 modifiable behaviors (physical activity, fruit and vegetable consumption, not drinking alcohol to excess, and not smoking) as well as sleep quality. Analysis: Behaviors were combined and formed a healthy lifestyle measure. Binary logistic regression was done to determine associations of healthy lifestyle and sociodemographic characteristics. Results: Only 5.8% of the adults reported a healthy lifestyle. The prevalence of having a healthy lifestyle varied among European countries. The lowest rates were in Hungary (1.3%) and Czech Republic (1.9%). The highest rates were in United Kingdom (8.6%) and Finland (9.2%). Those who presented a higher likelihood of having a healthy lifestyle were middle age (odds ratio [OR] = 1.20), older people (OR = 1.34), having higher household income (OR = 1.33), being a student (OR = 1.38), and retired (OR = 1.31). Those less likely to have a healthy lifestyle were lived without a partner (OR = 0.82), unemployed (OR = 0.73), and lived in rural areas (OR = 0.86). Conclusions: Few European adults were practicing 5 healthy behaviors. This should be a message for governments and be considered in the establishment of preventive public policies in the areas of health and health education.","culture change ; drink alcohol ; getting cooperized ; physical activity ; sleep quality ; smoking ; smoking ; social and physical health ; vegetables consumption",23,"Artigos em revista",,"Artes H Desporto",Scopus,N/A,"Escola Nacional de Saúde Pública, Universidade Nova de Lisboa (Lisbon, Portugal); Faculdade de Motricidade Humana, Universidade de Lisboa (Cruz Quebrada - Dafundo, Portugal); Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa (Lisbon, Portugal); Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal); Universidad de Guadalajara (Guadalajara, Mexico)",N/A,N/A,"Adilson Marques; Miguel Peralta; João Martins; Vânia Loureiro; Paola Cortés Almanzar; Margarida Gaspar de Matos","0000-0001-9850-7771; N/A; 0000-0003-2458-3004",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

This manuscript aims to understand how digital communication has helped the tourism industry in general and the hotel context in particular to face the negative consequences caused by the new coronavirus pandemic. The development of the research followed a qualitative methodological approach, constituting an exploratory study, based on four semi-structured interviews with managers of hotel establishments, located in the Northern Region of Portugal and Galicia. As main conclusions, it is possible to highlight that digital communication and the use of social networks were fundamental tools for hotel establishments during the pandemic caused by COVID-19, especially during the confinement period, when establishments had to close, many of them completely. There were many changes brought about in the tourism industry in the Euroregion of Northern Portugal and Galicia (ERNPG), with an increase in domestic tourism, a decrease in the external market and a change in tourist profile and behavior, whether due to sanitary and public health issues that induced fear of travel, or by the measures imposed by the government that prevented such trips. According to the strategies implemented by the hotel establishments, the intensification of digital communication use and social networks stands out, since, for a long time, it consisted of the only connecting tool between the hotel and its customers and the initiatives of the Regional Entities and Turismo de Portugal (regional and national DMOs), through numerous training courses in the area of digital marketing and the implementation of hygiene, sustainable and safety measures in hotel establishments. Regarding the future of tourism, it is expected that it will recover in the coming years and approach the historical values of previous years, given the advance in vaccination against the disease and the tourist’s desire to travel. In the short term, strategies are expected from hotel establishments that include valuing the destination on digital marketing platforms through attracting qualified human resources and a commitment towards tourism sustainability.","crisis management ; cross-border region ; digital communication ; ERNPG ; sustainable concerns",5,"Artigos em revista",191,"Ciências Empresariais",Scopus,N/A,"GOVCOPP – Research Unit on Governance, Competitiveness and Public Policies (Aveiro, Portugal); Escola Superior de Hotelaria e Turismo (Vila do Conde, Portugal); Polytechnic Institute of Leiria (Leiria, Portugal); Instituto Politécnico do Cávado e do Ave (Barcelos, Portugal); Instituto Politécnico de Tomar (Tomar, Portugal); Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal)",N/A,N/A,"Diana Cardoso; Bruno Sousa; Dália Liberato; Pedro Liberato; Eunice Lopes; Francisco Gonçalves; Victor Figueira","N/A; 0000-0002-8588-2422; 0000-0003-0513-6444; 0000-0003-2908-1599; 0000-0001-9812-851X; 0000-0003-1965-7427; 0000-0002-2936-0195",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

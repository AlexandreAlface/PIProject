The promotion of healthy lifestyles is necessary to increase quality of life and well-being as people age. The aim of this study was to identify and synthesize interventions in middle-aged adults that promote healthy lifestyles and translate this knowledge into health gains. We performed a systematic review of the literature with research on the EBSCO Host—Research Databases platform. The methodology followed the PRISMA guidelines, and the protocol was registered with PROSPERO. A total of 10 articles out of 44 retrieved were included in this review, which identified interventions to promote healthy lifestyles with an impact on well-being, quality of life, and adherence to healthy behaviors. The synthesized evidence supports the efficacy of interventions that contributed to positive changes at the biopsychosocial level. Health promotion interventions were educational or motivational and related to physical exercise, healthy eating, and changes in habits and lifestyles related to harmful behaviors (tobacco use, excess carbohydrates in the diet, physical inactivity, and stress). The health gains found were increased mental health knowledge (self-actualization), adherence to physical exercise, improvement in physical condition, adherence to the consumption of fruits and vegetables, increased quality of life, and well-being. Health promotion interventions in middle-aged adults can significantly improve healthy lifestyles, protecting them from the negative effect of aging. For aging to be a successful experience, continuity of healthy lifestyles practiced in middle age is necessary.","health gains ; lifestyle ; middle-aged adults ; promoting health ; quality of life ; well-being",1,Review,50,Scopus,"ERDF  European Regional Development Fund",N/A,N/A

Methodologically, a hypothetical-deductive approach was used based on panel data collected from banks' published accounts. To generate results, grouped ordinary least squares were applied, as the Breusch-Pagan test confirms homoscedasticity, an essential assumption in this regression model. Internal variables considered include credit quality, capital adequacy, management quality, financial margin, and bank size, alongside an external variable, the Euribor. The findings reveal that credit risk, capital adequacy, management capacity, and Euribor are the most statistically significant for both return on equity and return on assets, with Euribor emerging as the greatest statistically significant variable.

In the literature there is no study that addresses whether different estimation methods can influence the value obtained for TE. The analysis of these factors is an important instrument for performance evaluation, by enabling firms to adopt more precise lines and benchmarking techniques. The data consist of 162 models, reporting on 63 scientific articles which empirically analyze the level of efficiency and productivity in the energy sector, from 1979 to 2013. The meta-regression model enables an understanding of the effects that different specifications of the models may have on the estimated values for efficiency.

Recently, a novel metric called Conditional Dependence Coefficient has been proposed to measure the dependence between subsets of variables.This paper introduces a novel filter feature selection method that integrates the Conditional Dependence Coefficient metric with an evolutionary algorithm to find the optimal feature subset. This approach combines the adaptability of genetic algorithms with the strength of an intuitive metric. Unlike many filter-based methods, our technique does not rely on parameters directly linked to the number of features (like thresholds). Moreover, it evaluates the collective merit of feature subsets rather than individual significance.We conducted tests on six different multivariate time-series datasets to address the forecasting challenge, determining the relevant lags. Considering no selection as baseline, experimental results indicate that our approach is competitive in terms of efficacy while demonstrating a reduction in the number of features selected.","feature selection ; genetic algorithm ; machine learning ; regression ; time-series forecasting",1,"Conference Paper",undefined,Scopus,"MCIN (PID2020-117954RBC22/AEI/10.13039/501100011033) Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación",N/A,N/A

However, students also face numerous interrelated concepts that should be given more attention to foster more effective and comprehensive learning. Often, students only get an incomplete knowledge of those concepts and their relations as no adequate reflection is promoted or even seen as necessary. The result is a superficial surface learning about essential programming concepts and their relations. This experience report presents a learning activity to promote deep learning of concepts and their relations. The activity challenges students to specify relations between concepts. Students search definitions for a given set of concepts and define relations between those concepts in textual form. To that end, they use a freely available tool that produces a graph from textual descriptions. This tool dramatically simplifies and speeds up the creation of readable graphical representations. Although many different courses can take advantage of the presented activity, we present the activity's application to an introductory object-oriented programming course. We also present and discuss the student's feedback, which was highly positive. In the end, we provide recommendations, including possible variations. These can help educators to effectively foster active learning of concepts and their relations in their classrooms.","active-learning ; concept maps ; concepts ; education ; learning activity ; object-oriented programming ; ontologies ; oop ; pedagogy",0,"Conference Paper",7,Scopus,"FCT  Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia",N/A,N/A

We recruited 447 young Portuguese athletes/participants (340 males, 107 females; Mage = 15.72 years, SD = 1.8). We had participants complete Portuguese sport versions of the Perceived Autonomy Support Exercise Climate Questionnaire, the Basic Psychological Needs in Exercise Scale, the Behavior Regulation Sport Questionnaire and the Perceived Performance in Sport Questionnaire. A gender invariant structural equation model showed that the coach’s autonomy support significantly predicted the satisfaction of psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness. The satisfaction of these three psychological needs predicted autonomous motivation. Satisfying the need for competence positively predicted perceived sport performance, but autonomous motivation was not significantly related to perceived performance.","autonomy support ; interpersonal style ; motivation ; performance ; psychological needs ; sport",13,Review,undefined,Scopus,"UHU  Universidad de Huelva",N/A,N/A

Through environmental measurements and student surveys, thermal perceptions, preferences and factors such as position within the classroom were analysed. The results reveal that NV classrooms offer sustainable benefits, but their effectiveness decreases when outside temperatures exceed 28 °C, increasing thermal discomfort. In contrast, AC classrooms maintain more stable and comfortable conditions, although they have thermal gradients that affect specific zones, such as areas near windows or air vents. This study highlights the need for hybrid strategies that prioritise NV in moderate temperatures and use AC as a support in extreme conditions.

These demonstrations are an artistic expression in which performativity lato sensu plays a major role in the country's cultural and artistic renewal. The present study frames this phenomenon as a specific cultural manifestation of the Portuguese worldview in the 1980s, building up the paradigmatic case of the Pop Dell'Arte band as well as on possible historical reasons for its unfolding.","Experimentalism ; Performativity ; Pop Dell'Arte ; Portuguese Eighties ; Post-avangarde",0,Review,undefined,Scopus,N/A,N/A,N/A

The importance of the performing arts and experimental poetry within this transition period is identifed and highlighted through the analysis of some of the aesthetic changes that took place during the ""dysphoric hangover"" following the 1974 Carnation Revolution. The analysis centers around a series of poetry happenings organized at the time by Ana Hatherly, E. M. de Melo e Castro, Fernando Aguiar, and Alberto Pimenta. The aim is to describe the specificities of the volatile and celebratory aesthetic phenomenology characterizing these artistic experiments.","Cultural change ; Eighties ; Experimental poetry ; Happening ; Performative art",1,Article,undefined,Scopus,N/A,N/A,N/A

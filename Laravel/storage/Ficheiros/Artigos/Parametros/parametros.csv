SCOPUS_ID:85088705995,"The game to promote the capability of reducing, reuse and recycling waste","Elsa Rodrigues; Luís Bruno","Rodrigues E.","E3S Web of Conferences",10.1051/e3sconf/202017101012,25550403,,171,,,2020-06-09,"This work aims to raise awareness of environmental problems through interactive means, which, today, are much more appealing than the traditional ones to the academic community. To better inform community members of the importance of the 3Rs - Reduce, Reuse and Recycle, it was decided to develop an interactive 3D game, accessible through the Word Wide Web. This game includes 3 different activities which can be played in any order: solid waste recycling, saving water, and saving electricity. A small group of people evaluated the games; all participants were familiar with video games. It should be noted that the tests carried out focused only on the usability and interactivity of the game - the impact of the game at the 3Rs level - Reduce, Reuse and Recycle - has not been tested yet. The game makes the user more aware of the physical space where he moves (the school), showing his progress in real time. At the end of the game, the user is presented with the total time he took to finish his tasks and the total score achieved. In this way, the game becomes more interesting to the user.",,"Não disponível",1,"Artigos em conferência",01012,Engenharia,Scopus,"NAWA  Narodowa Agencja Wymiany Akademickiej",N/A,N/A,"N/A; 0000-0001-8445-6651; 0000-0003-3313-7858","Não disponível","Instituto Politécnico de Beja (Beja, Portugal)"

While simulated practice is a growing pedagogical strategy, several studies have examined its strengths and limitations. However, evidence of its effectiveness in developing clinical reasoning skills among nursing students still needs to be improved. This systematic review aims to assess the benefits of simulated practice in enhancing the clinical reasoning skills of undergraduate nursing students. Methods: A systematic review will be conducted using three databases: CINAHL, MEDLINE, and PubMed. The search strategy will include MeSH terms ""simulation,"" ""nursing students,"" ""nursing education,"" and ""clinical reasoning."" Inclusion criteria: Studies published within the last five years (2017–2022) involving undergraduate nursing students and using simulated practice as an intervention. Two independent reviewers will conduct Data extraction and synthesis, with disagreements resolved by a third reviewer, as follows: • Identify the benefits of simulated practice in clinical reasoning among nursing students. • Analyze studies that utilize simulated practice as an intervention. • Evaluate the effectiveness of simulated practice in developing clinical reasoning skills.","Clinical competence ; Clinical reasoning ; Evidence-based education ; Nursing education ; Nursing students ; Pedagogical strategies ; Simulation","Não disponível",0,"Artigos em revista",103144,Engenharia,Scopus,Teste,N/A,N/A,"N/A; 0000-0001-8687-4291; 0000-0001-6017-6874","Não disponível","University of Évora (Evora, Portugal); Universidade de Aveiro (Aveiro, Portugal); Universidade Católica Portuguesa (Lisbon, Portugal); Gabinete de Formação (Evora, Portugal); Unidade Local de Saúde do Alentejo Central (Evora, Portugal)"
